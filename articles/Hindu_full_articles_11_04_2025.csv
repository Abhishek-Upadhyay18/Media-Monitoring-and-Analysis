"PNB MetLife, Religare Health tie up","PNB MetLife India Insurance Co. Ltd. has tied-up with Religare Health Insurance to offer a product that would cover health, death and illness, said a top official.

“We have tied up with Religare Health Insurance, wherein we will bundle and sell their health insurance policy with our life insurance policy,” said Sameer Bansal, chief distribution officer, PNB MetLife India Insurance Co. Ltd.

“The product will be offered during mid-December. It will be a seamless integration [exercise] to ensure that it comes as a single policy to a customer,” Mr. Bansal said.The tie-up will offer additional earning opportunity for the life insurer’s distribution channel partners,” he said.

Asked about the growth plans, he said for FY20 the life insurer had set target of 18-20% growth in top-line, increasing the number of branches from 107 to 200 in two years and policy renewal ratio from 78% to 81%.

Talking about the Tamil Nadu business, he said it was the fourth largest life insurance market for the firm after Maharashtra, New Delhi and Karnataka. The life insurer secured about 3% of its premium from Tamil Nadu, which was low and plans were on to raise it further.

“Since the base in Tamil Nadu is small, we are posting good growth. We have aggressive plans for Tamil Nadu to expand base and to appoint more agents,” he said.

PNB MetLife ended FY19 with a total premium (including renewal premium) of about ₹4,000 crore and in the first five months of the current year it has done ₹1,200 crore, registering 18%-20% growth. “Despite slowdown, we are on track,” he added.

PNB MetLife launches VR-based customer service platform,"Private life insurance firm PNB MetLife on Monday launched a virtual reality-based customer service platform.

Customers need to visit select PNB MetLife branches and wear the VR headset to get their service requirements addressed. Assisting them in this process would be an insurance expert based out of another location. The platform would display policy related information and engage customers through visual assist elements like animation, the company said.

It is the first-of-its-kind in the insurance sector, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) member (life) Nilesh Sathe said at an event in the city after IRDAI Chairman T.S. Vijayan launched the facility.

The conVRse platform would initially be available in 15 branches across 10 cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Jammu, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, and Pune. Noting that the company has been experimenting with the VR facility in Delhi for six months now, PNB MetLife managing director and CEO Tarun Chugh said the company would be extending the facility to all the 130 branches in phases and then eventually to customers homes.

Counting the advantages, Mr. Chugh said it would help customers be better informed about their policy and reduce misselling. He expected the facility to become popular as the price of the headsets is on the decline. From Rs. 33,000 a few years ago, the cost hovers around Rs. 7,500 a device, and was expected to come down further.

Mr. Vijayan said IRDAI was keen on customers getting the best service, irrespective of whether they were in rural or urban areas. The developments in technology, he said, should make it happen.

Insurance sector has been a bit slow in adopting technology, Mr. Sathe said. “Going forward, traditional insurance companies will find it difficult if they do not adopt technology.”

Later, to a query he replied that the growth in new business premium till November was 38 per cent and was expected to be 20 to 25 per cent by the end of the fiscal.

Forum directs MetLife to offset Rs. 16.72 lakh loan,"Terming the insurance company’s rejection of a claim as ‘unjust and improper’, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-III, Hyderabad, directed MetLife India Insurance Company Limited to offset the outstanding amount on a loan of Rs.16.72 lakh taken by a consumer.

The consumer forum also ruled that rejecting the claim amounted to deficiency of service, and asked the company to pay a compensation of Rs. 50,000.

The order passed on June 9 was the result of a petition filed by Surekha Nallwar, a resident of Khairatabad, who approached the Forum after MetLife Insurance Company Limited rejected an insurance claim for a policy taken by her son N. Praveen Kumar, for which she was the only nominee.

The single premium policy was taken on October 31, 2008, for a sum of Rs. 22,025.

The said policy was taken to offset any outstanding payments on a housing loan amount of Rs. 16,72,025 taken by Mr. Kumar, and it covered his property and life.

The last EMI of Rs. 9,494 was paid by Mr. Kumar on January 7, 2009, on the loan. The next day, Mr. Kumar collapsed due to a seizure, after which he was rushed to Global Hospital at Lakdikapul.

After check-up and tests were done on Mr. Kumar, he was asked to come for a review to the hospital on January 22. However, he died on January 20 itself due to a ‘cardio respiratory arrest’.

After that, his mother, the complainant, approached the insurance company to claim the amount required for the loan on grounds of accidental death.

However, Ms. Nallwar’s request was rejected by the company, which stated that her son had died on the 82{+n}{+d}day after he took the policy, before completion of the 90-day waiting period.

In response to her complaint, MetLife Insurance Company Limited said that since Mr. Kumar’s death was caused due to a ‘cardio respiratory arrest’ and was not an accident.

It pointed out that the policy stated that during the waiting period, benefits will not be paid ‘on death to causes other than accident’.

After going through all the evidence at hand, the Forum however ruled that the company was at fault and liable to pay Ms. Nallwar the remaining amount of the housing loan, along with a compensation of Rs.50,000.

The ruling bench noted that “even on compassionate grounds the insurer ought to have not taken a technical objection for a mere 8 days short of the stipulated 90 days.”

PNB Metlife launches AI-powered customer service app,"Life insurer PNB Metlife has unveiled an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered customer service app ‘Khushi’. The app is designed to be a one-stop shop providing insurance-related information, anytime, anywhere, such as policy features, premium due details besides providing fund value and portfolio details. It has the ability to understand customer intent and provide tailored responses, the company said.

Khushi can interact with customers via text as well as speech. When requested, the app can also locate the nearest PNB MetLife branch, arrange a call back from call centre representatives, fix an appointment with an advisor and much more, according to the company.

The app, which is available for android phones, has been built by MetLife’s innovation center - Lumen Lab — in Singapore with PNB MetLife in India.

Unveiling the app, managing director and CEO of PNB MetLife Ashish Srivastava said the AI-powered app would deliver enhanced customer experience. “We will continue our digitisation efforts and explore innovative platforms as traditional ways of selling insurance and servicing customers evolve,” he said in a release.

"Badminton | Consistency will be the key in the Asian Games, says Satwiksairaj","The upcoming Asian Games in China is like a Mini Olympics and the competition will be really tough, especially in doubles, according to R. Satwiksairaj.

In an informal chat at the unveiling of the trophy for the PNB-Metlife Trophy junior badminton championship to be held in Hyderabad in October, the champion doubles shuttler said the chances of a medal could be 50-50.

“It is never going to be easy. We cannot take anyone lightly. And, I don’t think numbers matter (being World No. 3 along with his partner Chirag Shetty),” he said.

“Consistency will be the key as we aim to do well in what is also the second Asian Games for us. We don’t want to think too much other than taking it match by match as always to avoid any sort of pressure,” Satwik said.

“The mantra for our success is that results have been excellent after we started spending more time together off the court. The chemistry is superb. We speak to each other in a very free and frank manner. There is nothing to talk behind each other. And, we know our job better,” he explained.

“In majors like the Commonwealth Games, and Worlds we play our hearts out and it will be no different in the coming Asiad. It is not that we don’t give 100 per cent in other tournaments. But, definitely there will be more than 100 in these championships,” Satwik said.

For his part, Chirag said that they won the Indonesian Open title after a couple of early round losses in the events preceding that major.

“So, I don’t think we are too concerned about our recent results,” he said.

“Right from the day our journey began as doubles players, we kept things simple. Treat both wins and losses on par. We will be neither really happy after a win nor extremely sad after a loss. Every day is a new day with fresh challenges,” Chirag said.

“Personally, it is a nice feeling to be World No. 3 but again as Satwik said, these things don’t matter though we would be definitely happy to be World No. 1,” he said.

Congratulations to #IndianOil's dynamic duo of @satwiksairaj and @Shettychirag04 for the spirited, gritty win at the #KoreanOpen2023! 🏆🏸 Boys, your winning streak has brought immense joy to us and the country. Your comeback proved that champions are undeterred by setbacks.… pic.twitter.com/zs0uae06ce

The duo, mentors at PNB Metlife, said they owed a lot to their parents and family members who never put any kind of pressure on them.

“In fact, my mother often tells me not to get disappointed after a loss as the parents of the other players could be praying for their sons’ success,” Chirag said with a big smile.

Taylor Swift’s fashion tips,"Singer Taylor Swift surprised a male fan on blogging website Tumblr by giving him style tips for his prom.

The fan posted a photograph of himself posing in two different looks and captioned the image saying: “So prom is on Thursday and I need to know, tie or bow tie?”

The                         Shake It Off         hit-maker then surprised the boy with her response and suggested that he wear the tie to look like a “modern movie star”.

“I like the tie, but honestly, both are great. I just feel like you look like a 50s movie star in the bow tie, but more like a modern movie star in the tie. Depends on what vibe you’re wanting to convey, but I’d say the tie. Great suit btw! (sic),” Swift replied.

And while Swift is happy to dish out style advice, she previously revealed she turns to friends Lena Dunham and Zooey Deschanel for inspiration when it comes to her own outfits.

“For fashion inspiration... Lena Dunham always has great websites and shops at great stores. She always tells me her newest obsession, whether it is a new website, a blog or a store; she’s really good with that stuff. And Zooey Deschanel is one of the most fashionable people I know,” she said.

Tata Sons plans to sell 3% stake in TCS,"Tata Sons plans to sell a three per cent stake in the country’s largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services, for Rs.14,700 crore and acquire a 70 per cent stake in PNB Metlife for Rs.2,700 crore.

It also plans to sell a 30 per cent stake in its renewable power venture for Rs.3,000 crore. These were decisions approved during the last few board meetings, according to the minutes of the Tata Sons meeting, which was filed as part of Mistry’s petition against Tata Sons.

Tata Sons FY17 business plan projected total income of Rs.8,103 crore and expenses of Rs.2,425 crore, resulting in an estimated profit of Rs.5,677 crore. The business plan included a proposal to sell 3 per cent in cash cow TCS for meeting a part of the fund requirements during the year. Profit of Rs.14,700 crore was estimated on the sale, according to the minutes of Tata Sons’ September board meeting. The board was however informed that the proposed sale of TCS stake was work in progress and could be spread over two years.

At the October 24 board meeting it was decided that Tata AIA Life Insurance Company Limited would be putting a non-binding bid to acquire a 70 per cent stake in PNB Metlife for Rs.2,700 crore. Met holds 26 per cent stake in PNB Metlife, 21 per cent stake is being held by Elpro, 18 per cent by M Paloonji & Company and 5 per cent by Jammu & Kashmir Bank Limited and the rest by Punjab National Bank.

Mr. Ishaat Hussain proposed a deal structure under which Tata along with AIA would buy out the existing stake of all stake holders in PNB Metife, aggregating to 70 per cent, other than that of Punjab National Bank, followed by a merger of the two insurers.

The initial outgo from Tata Sons would be in the range of Rs.1,500 crore to Rs.2,700 crore with Tata Sons holdings in Tata AIA Life Insurance Company expected to be diluted from 51 per cent to 45 per cent post the deal.

Vodafone proposal

In the June board meeting of Tata Sons, Nitin Nohria reported on his discussions with the CEO of Vodafone, who continued to be interested in acquiring Tata Teleservives Limited (TTSL).

Dr. Nohria mentioned that the start of Reliance Jio was expected to impact the existing telecom players including Vodafone. He explained that Vodafone would be serious about consolidation in order to make up for the losses of customers to Jio.

Renewable power

In a presentation on Tata Power before a board meeting in June, when Tata bought the assets of Welspun Renewables Energy for Rs. 10,000 crore, Anil Sardana, MD & CEO Tata Power informed the board that the acquisition was proposed to be initially funded by borrowing of Rs.3,500 crore for investment into Tata Power Renewable Energy and another Rs.500 crore at the holding company level.

“Within a year, a 30 per cent dilution TPREL was envisaged by the TPC management to raise Rs.3,000 to Rs.3,600 crore to repay a significant portion of the acquisition debt,” Mr. Sardana said, citing investors who had spoken of a 8-9 per cent multiple on renewable investments compared with 6 per cent for Tata Power.

2026 FIFA World Cup final to be played in New Jersey,"The 2026 World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, U.S., on July 19.

FIFA made the announcement Sunday at a Miami television studio, allocating the opener of the 39-day tournament spread across three North American nations to Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca on June 11 and the finale to the home of the NFL's New York Jets and Giants.

“It will be a celebration of our diversity and our values,” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said in a telephone interview. “The bigger picture is what leads up to it and what we leave behind for the decades to come.”

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had lobbied for the final to be at his AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

“The competition was dealing with the perception of the coastal, of a New York, or a Los Angeles,” he said. “If this were totally being played to just America and the United States, that wouldn’t have been such a formidable thing to overcome. But internationally, that’s formidable to overcome.”

All games from the quarterfinals on are in the United States. Semifinals are on July 14 at AT&T Stadium and the following day at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

Quarterfinals are at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 9, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the following day, and at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 11. The third-place game will be at Hard Rock on July 18.

The U.S. team will train in suburban Atlanta ahead of the tournament and open at SoFi on June 12. The Americans play seven days later at Seattle’s Lumen Field and finish the group stage at SoFi on June 25.

Since reaching the semifinals of the first World Cup in 1930, the U.S. has advanced to the quarterfinals just once, in 2002.

Seventy-eight of 104 matches of the first World Cup held in three nations will be played in the U.S., with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada.

“It’s about making our nation proud,” American coach Gregg Berhalter said. “One way to really grow the game and to change football in America forever is to perform well and do something that no U.S. team has ever done before.”

AT&T, which had hopes to present the final, will host a tournament-high nine matches. There will be eight each at MetLife, SoFi and Mercedes Benz; seven apiece at Hard Rock, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and NRG Stadium in Houston; and six apiece at Lumen, Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

FIFA officials did not publicly explain their site-decision process.

Philadelphia’s final match will be a round-of-16 meeting on July 4, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park hosts baseball's All-Star Game, likely on July 14.

Santa Clara is the only U.S. site that will not host a game after the new round of 32.

FIFA expanded the World Cup from 32 to 48 nations, increased matches from 64 and announced the 16 sites in 2022.

Murphy learned of the decision while at a watch party in a MetLife Stadium suite. He was not discouraged by a British tabloid report on Jan. 17 that the final would be at AT&T.

“We did everything we could to put our head downs, focus on the job at hand, kind of push out the noise, and that turned out to be a winning formula,” Murphy said,

Mexico will play its second match at Estadio BBVA in Monterrey on June 18 and return to Azteca on June 24. Mexico City will host five matches, with four each in Monterrey and Guadalajara's Estadio Akron.

Canada will play its opening first-round match in Toronto on June 12, then its following two games in B.C. Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 18 and 24. Each Canada venue will host 13 games.

A nation will need to play eight matches to win the title, up from seven since 1982.

All 11 of the U.S. stadiums are home to NFL teams. Hard Rock will host this year’s Copa América final on July 14, while MetLife was the site of the 2016 Copa América final.

Both the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals were at Azteca.

When the U.S. hosted the 24-nation, 52-game tournament in 1994, the final was at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the opener at Chicago’s Soldier Field and the semifinals at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford and the Rose Bowl.

With the additional teams, the length of the tournament will grow from 29 days in the shortened 2022 schedule in Qatar and 32 days for the 2018 tournament in Russia.

Only one match will involve a team that has not had at least three off days. FIFA divided the group stage into East, Central and West regions and intended to make travel shorter for group winners.

The stadiums in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed because of summer heat, and Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

Artificial turf will be replaced by grass in Arlington, Atlanta, East Rutherford, Foxborough, Houston, Inglewood and Vancouver.

Several of the venues are expected to widen their surfaces to accommodate a 75-by-115 yard (68-by-105 meter) playing field, including AT&T and MetLife.

FIFA did not announce kickoff times. The 1994 championship started at 12:30 p.m. PDT (3:30 p.m. EDT and 9:30 p.m. in Central Europe) but the start has been moved up in recent years as Asia’s television market become more significant to FIFA. The 2022 final in Qatar started at 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. EDT, 4 p.m. in Central Europe and 10 p.m. in Beijing).

Anmol lone top seed to survive,"Anmol Joon was the lone No. 1 seed to survive the arduous qualifying event in the PNB Metlife Chaaji memorial all-India sub-junior badminton tournament here on Wednesday.

Anmol had defeated Ravi Uttej Ayyagari Phani 15-7, 15-10 in the penultimate round in a qualifying draw of 256 in the boys’ under-13 event, and is set to meet Vivek Bansal in the final qualifying round.

While the top seeds in the other events, Shivani Nibadiya (u-13 girls), Rahul Kane (u-15 boys) and Lakshmi Priyanka (u-15 girls) failed to make it, it was a gigantic task for the organisers to go through hundreds of matches in the boys and girls sections in the two age groups, in singles and doubles, within three days.

The entries were overwhelming with 239 (u-13 boys), 150 (u-13 girls), 401 (u-15 boys) and 287 (u-15 girls) in the four sections. The main draw featuring 64 players in the u-13 boys section, and 32 players in the other three singles events, will be played from Thursday to Saturday. The tournament, offering a total scholarship fund of Rs. 300,000, has already proved to be a “'round the clock” badminton festival for the players and their parents. — Special Correspondent

‘Best performance of my career’ - Sai Praneeth,"“This is the best performance of my career,” said B. Sai Praneeth shortly after winning the $350, 000 MetLife BWF Super Series-OUE Singapore Open men’s singles title at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.

“There is nothing like winning the crown,” he told                         The Hindu        , even when compared to his defeats of badminton heavyweights Lee Chong Wei and Taufiq Hidayat.

“I dedicate this win to my family, Gopi Sir (chief National coach Pullela Gopichand), coaches and support staff at the academy,” he said referring to the institution in Hyderabad where he trains.

Retracing his steps to the title, the men’s singles world No. 30 said: “After losing the first game, I equalised at seven, 11 and 12. When I got ahead by two points, I got confidence to pull off the victory. I found my rhythm and thereon the going was good,” said the Human Resources Executive with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), posted to Chennai but who trains in his hometown Hyderabad through most of the year.

Did he regret having to defeat his academy-mate and compatriot Kidambi Srikanth 17-21, 21-17, 21-12 for the title ? “I felt a little bad about playing a fellow-Indian in the final. Srikanth also has big victories in his career and he deserved to be in the final,” said Sai, a B. Com. graduate from St. Joseph’s College, Himayathnagar in Hyderabad, while paying tribute to his opponent in the final.

What’s Praneeth like outside badminton? “I have no memorable achievement outside the sport. I enjoy movies and hanging out with friends,” added the 24-year-old, who won the Canadian Open Grand Prix last year and made the final of the Syed Modi Grand Prix this year.

Rahman rocks at IIFA show,"The 18th IIFA Rocks was a celebration of A.R. Rahman's journey in cinema. And nothing could dampen the spirit tonight. Not even the incessant rains that conspired since morning. Though they were intermittent rains, they too gave themselves a breather post 10 p.m. just to allow the maestro enthrall the audience.

The host for the night Manish Paul and Riteish Deshmukh had the audience in splits with their one liners. The show started with Kamal Khan singing all the Chartbusters and also had the audience grooving to many of the Salman Khan numbers.

Hyderabad poised to attract more BFSI facilities,"Hyderabad is poised to consolidate its position as a preferred destination for facilities of Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) firms on the back of its strategic location as well as government’s commitment to foster a thriving business environment.

The city is likely to attract more major BFSI players in the coming quarters thus strengthening its position as a comprehensive business destination catering to diverse industries, government sources said, citing as examples the decision of Cigna Healthcare, Lloyds Bank, Swiss Re, MetLife, DTCC and Ameriprise.

While Hyderabad has emerged as a prominent IT hub, the first half of 2024 (January-June) saw several BFSI organisations establishing presence signifying a significant shift contributing to Hyderabad’s position as a well-rounded business hub. The developments reflect the growing confidence in the city’s robust infrastructure, skilled workforce, overall business environment and a stable political environment.

The office leasing activity is an indicator of growing engagement of BFSI in Hyderabad with the sector H1-2024 accounting for as much one third of office space offtake. It also highlights the supportive, robust ecosystem Hyderabad fosters and benefits not just large corporations but also for startups within the BFSI sector.

Messi targets Copa Centenario cup,"Lionel Messi and Argentina will be targeting the country’s 23-year title drought when the Copa America Centenario kicks off on Friday after a troubled build-up marred by corruption allegations which threatened to derail the event.

One hundred years after Uruguay clinched the inaugural four-team South American championship in Argentina, 16 teams from across the Americas are gathered in the United States for a special one-off edition of the tournament.

The three-week festival of football gets under way at the Levi's Stadium in California on Friday, when the United States face Colombia at the home of the San Francisco 49ers American football team.

The tournament will conclude with a final at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on June 26, drawing a line under what is arguably the biggest tournament held in the United States since the 1994 World Cup.

Billed as a celebration of football across the Americas, 10 South American teams and six teams from the CONCACAF (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) region make up the field.

For organizers, the mere fact that the tournament is taking place at all is something of a triumph.

For several months last year the Copa faced an uncertain future after the arrest and indictment for corruption of several officials from South America and CONCACAF responsible for dreaming up the tournament.

'World Cup of Fraud':         When plans for the tournament were launched at a glitzy event in Miami in 2014, CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb stood proudly alongside South American federation (CONMEBOL) chief Eugenio Figueredo.

“The American continent may have been discovered in 1492, but I can't imagine a better way to unite this continent than with football,” Webb said.

Yet if prosecutors have their way, both men may soon be united behind bars.

Webb and Figueredo were among several officials arrested in Switzerland in May 2015 as part of the US-led corruption investigation which ultimately led to the sensational downfall of FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

With impeccable timing, Webb is due to appear in a New York courtroom on Friday — the day of the opening match — to face sentencing for his role in the scandal.

Figueredo, 84, was extradited to Uruguay from Switzerland last December and also faces criminal prosecution.

Both Figueredo and Webb — as well as former CONMEBOL chief Nicolas Leoz — are accused of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes linked to the award of media rights for the tournament, part of a scam dubbed a ""World Cup of Fraud"".

'We deserve championship'        : The sleazy background to the competition threatened to take the shine off an event which will bring together some of the world's best players.

Messi and Argentina will be aiming to win the country's first major title since the 1993 Copa America after a series of recent near-misses.

The Argentines lost both the 2014 World Cup final and the 2015 Copa America in Chile. Messi, due in Spain this week to attend his trial for tax fraud, says it is time Argentina's talented players delivered.

“It has been a very long time since Argentina has won anything, and this group came very close in the World Cup and at the last Copa America,” he told Sports Illustrated on the eve of the tournament.

“I think we deserve to be champions of an important competition.”

Argentina opens their campaign against Chile in Santa Clara next Monday. Panama and Bolivia complete Group D.

The United States meanwhile will aim to build on their encouraging performance at the 2014 World Cup, when they reached the knockout round, by progressing from a ""Group of Death"" which includes Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay.

Five-time World Cup winners Brazil will be favoured to safely navigate Group B, where they face Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.

The Brazilians open against Ecuador at Pasadena's Rose Bowl on Saturday — scene of their victory at the 1994 World Cup final.

Mexico and Uruguay will be expected to progress from Group C, with Jamaica and Venezuela completing the field.                         © AFP, 2016

‘Saina Squad’ makes its presence felt,"They could become the Indian equivalent of the Barmy Army, the British band of cricket enthusiasts who follow the fortunes of their team, crossing seas.

A motley crew of 18 die-hard fans, drawn from a string of contests on social media conducted by STAR Sports shadowed Saina Nehwal in the MetLife BWF World superseries. Outfitted with dark blue personalised jerseys, travel T-shirts with names, caps, badges and friendship bands, the ‘Saina Squad’ was visibly and vocally supportive of the Indian ace.

Out of the rooting Carolina Marin got during the BWF finals from a set of Spanish fans, all the more pronounced in the finals when Indonesian fans supported the world No. 1, was born the STAR Sports concept of a dedicated band of followers for Saina. Saina was excited for this was something she had never done before, said a STAR Sports marketing team member. A meet and greet programme was held on the eve of the championship, where the ‘Saina Squad’, flown in from India, met its favourite sportsperson.

The world No. 2’s first round defeat to Nozomi Okuhara was more than made up for by a fighting win over world champion Carolina Marin. “We’ll continue to back you,” the squad had told Saina after that first setback against the Japanese shuttler.

The ‘Saina Squad’ was a mix of fans from across the country, ranging in age from 18 to 43 years. On Thursday night after the Indian ace’s victory over Marin, the squad was understandably elated. Before she left the stadium, Saina spent time with her fans, who shot selfies with her.

Meanwhile, Viktor Axelsen pulled off the biggest upset of the MetLife BWF World Superseries, toppling two-time world champion Chen Long 21-12, 21-17on Saturday. In the women’s semifinals, Nozomi Okuhara stunned the world champion 21-11, 21-12.

The results: (Semifinals): Men:         Viktor Axelson (Den) bt Chen Long (Chi) 21-12, 21-17; Kento Momoto (Jap) bt Jan O Jorgensen (Den) 21-19, 21-18.

Women:         Nozomi Okuhara (Jap) bt Carolina Marin (Spa) 21-11, 21-12; Wang Yihan (Chi) bt Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) 21-12, 21-12.

LIC eases claim settlement norms for Tamil Nadu customers,"Country’s largest insurer LIC has extended concessions and relaxations to policyholders affected by the floods in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

LIC has eased the procedure for settlement of claims on the lives of flood victims who are policyholders, the insurer said in a statement.

“These concessions and relaxations are in the nature of simplified procedure for death and disability claim settlement, loss of policy document claim settlement on the lives of ‘missing’ persons etc, similar to the concessions extended to the victims of floods and landslides in Uttarakhand in June 2013, flood disaster in J&K in September 2014, Cyclone in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha in October 2014 and Nepal disaster in April 2015,” it said.

The recent floods in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have caused injury and loss of lives on a big scale.

In a separate statement, PNB MetLife said it has set up a dedicated claims helpline for the Tamil Nadu flood victims with Toll free number                         18004256969         in an effort to provide relief and assistance to the victims.

PNB MetLife has streamlined the claim process for the aid of flood-affected customers where easy alternatives to the standard documents can be submitted.

Udta Punjab wins big at IIFA awards,"The 18th edition of the International Indian Film Academy awards ended on a high with                         Udta Punjab         winning four awards on Saturday night.                         Neerja         and                         Ae Dil Hai Mushkil         won three awards each.

Over 40,000 people cheered for their favourite Bollywood stars as they walked the IIFA Green Carpet ahead of the awards ceremony at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The hosts for the evening, Karan Johar and Saif Ali Khan, kept the audience in splits with great repartee and witty conversations with fellow Bollywood celebrities.

Alia Bhatt’s debut in IIFA saw her performing to a medley of hit songs from her movies. Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon wooed the audience with their crackling chemistry as they jived to retro tracks.

Katrina Kaif caused a storm on stage with her pulsating performance and Salman Khan danced away to songs from                         Tubelight        .

Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt walked away with the Best Actor awards for their film                         Udta Punjab        . The Best Direction award went to Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury for                         Pink         and                         Neerja         won the award for Best Film. In a special category, Taapsee Pannu won the Woman of the Year award for                         Pink        .

The Best Performance in a Negative Role title went to Jim Sarbh for                         Neerja        . Shakun Batra and Ayesha DeVitre won the award for the Best Story for                         Kapoor & Sons        .

‘ULIPs may attract more investors in 2018’,"Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has recorded 89% growth in new business premium in its unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs), riding on the boom in the equity markets. ULIPs would be an attractive investment option for retail investors in 2018, says                           Tarun Chugh          , the firm’s CEO and MD, in an interview. Edited excerpts:

What is the outlook for insurance industry in FY18?

The major trend in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) space is the uptake in the equity markets, especially from retail investors. We have seen 89% growth in new business premium of our Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) from April to September 2017. We also expect this trend to continue in the new year as equity markets are looking up. [We are] planning to launch more ULIP products in the months to come.

What are the three top trends in digitisation of insurance that you have seen in the last three years?

Insurers have realised the value of digitisation in insurance.

It leads to enhancement of customer experience, creates new business opportunities, helps in reducing costs, allows operational flexibility and drives engagement with customers on a real-time basis. The top three trends, addressing these business opportunities, would be: end-to-end paperless processes from presales to underwriting to post-sales services; growth in online sales; providing services which are quick, non-intrusive and available 24x7

Rapidly changing consumer behaviour is reshaping the insurance industry. How will digitisation impact customers?

Consumer behaviour has been reshaped with the advent of digital and e-commerce companies in the last two decades. This gamut of digitisation, brought in by these companies, is continuously evolving. Its impact can be seen in the way consumers, both new and traditional, are engaging with businesses. Consumers today have greater access to real time information. Hence, it is vital that organisations acknowledge this shift in consumer behaviour.

This change is challenging insurers, who are not digitally native, to focus on products, business models and service delivery models which are end-to-end digital. This will result in better offerings in the form of improvised offerings, reduced TATs (turn around time) and personalised experiences.

We are continuously investing in improving our offerings on the digital platforms, both through our own website and via web aggregators. Contribution of online sales to our entire portfolio has been increasing rapidly.

We are also embracing digitisation to stay in tune with the expectations of the end consumer and making our processes paperless. A customer today can have his proposal form digitally filled on a tab, complete his E-KYC via Aadhaar verification and have his policy document delivered electronically via mail and stored in IRDAI authorised e-repositories such as CAMS, KARVY and NSDL.

How has the agent-company relationship evolved?

At Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, agency continues to be the key distribution channel with nearly 86% of the retail-rated new business premium being routed through this channel. Nearly 77% of the company’s total customers are mass and sub-mass segments. Their ability to buy high premium products, multiple policies and risk-taking capacity was limited. Thus, this year, we focused on improving our product mix to cater to affluent and mass affluent segments.

In September, we introduced I-smart, a comprehensive portal for our agents. I-smart is available on mobile and tablet devices, and has already seen 12,500 downloads with 5,000 agents using it on a daily basis and 500 fresh downloads every day.

Today, mobile should be considered as the consumer’s remote control to start engagement with brand. From real-time executions to native campaigns, location-based targeting and advertising, mobile’s power is that it’s personal; all-pervasive – it’s with the consumers all day, from first thing in the morning till the last thing at night; and useful – it is consumed on the go. In other words, Mobile-based touchpoints will be the face for not only the life insurance sector, but also across BFSI space as mobile-based touchpoints can reduce complexities in underwriting, distribution and product servicing, and increase customer engagement on real time basis.

How do you ensure data security?

Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has implemented Data loss prevention (DLP) solution which protects sensitive information going outside company network via Mail, USB or Network. We have [also] implemented Mobile Device Management (MDM) for all mobile devices accessing company mails. This prevents users from downloading any attachment to mobile devices. All company-related information can be wiped out in case a device is lost.

In tier 2 / 3 markets, we have extensively used analytics to understand the customer needs better and thereafter provide the right product. We have worked on our product portfolio and have the right mix of product offerings across both Traditional and ULIP categories that suit customer needs. We are one of the largest players in the Tier 2 / 3 markets and are looking at further enhancing our presence by recruiting an additional 10,000 agents by the end of this fiscal. We have also intensified our insurance awareness drives by conducting roadshows and                         nukkad nataks         which educate consumers about the importance of being insured and to existing customers with policy renewal at their doorstep.

Why are so many insurance companies going in for IPOs?

IRDA’s (Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority) move to relax capital raising norms whereby it allowed insurance companies [in existence for] over 10 years to go public, has led to a slew of IPOs.

Listing on the stock market has been principally taken by companies to raise capital for expansion of operations, increase liquidity for shareholders, enhance brand image and create valuable currency stocks that can be used to make acquisitions and compensate employees.

It is likely these IPOs will bring about better awareness regarding insurance services among the investing public. That may translate into an increase in insurance penetration (percentage of insurance premia to GDP), better products and enhanced service standards.

Does Bajaj Allianz Life also have plans for an IPO?

No, we are not looking at an IPO [any time] soon.

Messi targets Copa Centenario cup,"Lionel Messi and Argentina will be targeting the country’s 23-year title drought when the Copa America Centenario kicks off on Friday after a troubled build-up marred by corruption allegations which threatened to derail the event.

One hundred years after Uruguay clinched the inaugural four-team South American championship in Argentina, 16 teams from across the Americas are gathered in the United States for a special one-off edition of the tournament.

"Diplodocus, again","With its walnut-sized brain mounted atop a 26-foot-long telescopic neck, the Diplodocus failed to grasp the the implications of the orange-red shooting star, which was becoming brighter by the hour. He continued to relish the tasty tree-top vegetation, beating his shorter but more vicious competitors. That was 65 million years ago.

On July 12, 2017, sitting in the comfy living room in our southern Indian home, my attention was focussed on the TV show, live broadcast of the IIFA (Indian International Film Academy) Award function, held at the ‘brim-filled’ Metlife stadium at New York, with the Bollywood glitterati dancing and prancing about, on a high-voltage digital stage.

Meanwhile, an event

I too failed to grasp the implications of an unusual ecological event happening silently on the same day. Some 9,500 miles south of New York, on the northwestern coast of icy Antarctica, the final separation of the ‘Larsen C’ ice shelf was under way.

I tried search ‘the greatest rift on earth’ and ended up reading one that began behind closed doors in a  Beverly Hills home in Los Angeles, and ended in a private courtroom, where Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie separated, upsetting thousands of their fans.

In contrast, the MIDAS site representing the U.K.-based Antarctic Research project, tracking the developing rift in Antarctica, had few visitors; ‘Larsen C’ perhaps did not authorise them to use click-bait.

Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, was sailing along the icy coast of Antarctica in December 1893.

The ice-shelf

Larsen quickly realised that the shoreline he was looking at was not a real one but a shelf of ice protruding out, like a balcony. The only difference was that the natural icy projection was a billion times larger than a balcony. Extending hundreds of miles  and thousands of square miles in area, the shelf was aptly named the ‘Larsen shelf’. They are designated A to E based on location.

The Aqua satellite, armed with MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer), primarily used to locate and assess water bodies, was the first to pick up a developing crack, a kind of mile-long fault line, in the ice-shelf of Larsen C.

Starting late-2014, scientists of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) working with satellite data tracking the rift found that the defect in the Larsen C was growing steadily. By 2016 the crack became 70 miles long and 300 feet wide. By January 2017 it measured 109 miles in length and 1,500 metres in breadth.

On July 12, it broke. The broken shelf, now an official iceberg, was massive, indeed the biggest-ever such iceberg, weighing 1.1 trillion tons and measuring 2,200 square miles.

The consequence

What is the consequence of this rift? The detachment of more than one trillion tons of ice shelf, floating out in the open sea, and eventually melting, is expected to result in, well, just nothing. Ocean levels all over the world will not even rise by 1 cm. It’s no doomsday.

The extinction of Dodo, the loss of hundreds of hectares of rainforest every year, the Royal Bengal Tiger population inching towards zero — none of this brought humanity close to doomsday. We will still enjoy our cup of hot coffee, drive to office and do our work.

The ‘Larsen C’ rift indicates the beginning of a major ecological shift, though. Despite our highly evolved ‘100-billion-neuron’ brain, we have decided to ignore it and munch on our burgers.

Just like the Diplodocus.

Higher provisioning hits PNB net,"The higher provision for bad debts and decline in treasury income had its impact on the revenue of Punjab National Bank (PNB) which posted a marginal 3.4 per cent rise in net profit at Rs.1,105 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2011, against Rs.1,068 crore in the year-ago period. Total income, however, grew by 37 per cent to Rs.9,399 crore from Rs.6,863 crore.

“The net profit has been impacted due to higher provisioning, decline in treasury income during the quarter,” Chairman and Managing Director K. R. Kamath told reporters here.

However, the operating profit rose by 18 per cent to Rs.2,474 crore from Rs.2,098 crore. The bank made a total provision of Rs.1,368 crore. Of this, Rs.566 crore was towards bad debts and Rs.475 crore for income tax. Net interest income grew by 20 per cent to Rs.3,155 crore. “There is upward bias on the rates. The bank will decide on the hike on Friday,” he said.

The bank had decided to join hands with MetLife India for a proposed entry into the life insurance segment. “We have considered offers made by various companies and selected MetLife India as our partner,” Mr. Kamath said.

During the year, the bank's net interest margin declined to 3.84 per cent from 3.91 per cent at the end of June, 2010. Capital adequacy of the bank as at the end of June as per the Basel-II norms was 12.42 per cent at the end of June, 2011.

Significantly, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a proportion of advances went up to 2 per cent from 1.82 per cent. Net NPAs also rose to 0.86 per cent from 0.66 per cent. Asserting that gross NPA level was not alarming, Mr. Kamath said the bank had put focus on recovery.

Chile stun Argentina to lift Copa America title,"Holders Chile stunned Argentina to win the Copa America Centenario in a penalty shootout on Sunday as Lionel Messi's title curse struck again.

Messi blazed a penalty over the bar in the shoot-out before Lucas Biglia missed to leave Chile's Francisco Silva with the task of stroking home the winning spot-kick at the MetLife Stadium.

It was a carbon copy of last year's Copa America final, also won by Chile on penalties after a goalless draw.

Argentina's players meanwhile were left disconsolate as they digested a third defeat in a major final following losses to Germany in the 2014 World Cup and Chile in last year's Copa.

The defeat also ensured Argentina's 23-year wait for a major title — and a first for five-time world player of the year Messi — continued.

The final had gone to penalties after finishing deadlocked at 0-0 after 120 minutes.

Both sides were reduced to 10 men in the first half as Brazilian referee Heber Lopes struggled to get a grip on an ill-tempered contest played in front of a crowd of 82,026.

The first yellow card of the match came in the 16th minute when Marcelo Diaz brought down Messi with a cynical hack across the thighs as the Barcelona star advanced on the Chilean goal.

Argentina should have taken the lead on 21 minutes when a defensive blunder from Gary Medel, miscontrolling a back pass, allowed Gonzalo Higuain to go clean through on goal.

Chile let-off

Higuain had time and space but opted to lift his shot over the advancing Bravo and it rolled wide of the post in a huge let-off for Chile.

It was a nightmarish case of deja vu for Higuain, who missed potentially match winning chances in both the 2014 World Cup final and last year's Copa America.

Seven minutes later Chile were left rocking when Messi burst forward only to be bodychecked blatantly by Diaz.

For a moment it appeared that referee Lopes had forgotten Diaz's earlier caution but eventually he brandished a red card and Chile were down to 10.

It ought to have been a warning to both sides but the spiteful tone continued for the remainder of the half, with Javier Mascherano and Arturo Vidal next into the book in the 37th minute.

The next flare-up came on 40 minutes when Messi darted into the box at high speed and tumbled over following a collision with Jose Pedro Fuenzalida.

Chile's players surrounded Lopes demanding a yellow card for a dive and Messi was duly booked even though it looked for all the world as if he had simply gone down after being caught off balance.

Two minutes from half-time and Lopes was reaching for a red card, this time sending off Manchester United's Marcos Rojo for a rough tackle on Vidal.

The cards continued in a fractious start to the second half, Jean Beausejour booked for hacking at Gabriel Mercado.

A cynical foul on Messi by Charles Aranguiz resulted in another yellow card.

The introduction of Sergio Aguero for Higuain had little effect with Argentina failing to break the stalemate.

Chile striker Eduardo Vargas went close on the 80th minute, thumping a fierce low shot that Romero did well to block at his near post.

Aguero had a chance to steal victory in the 84th minute when he was worked into space on the right of the box but he blazed his shot high and wide.

There was still time for late drama when Ramiro Funes-Mori made a stunning match-saving block to deny Alexis Sanchez.

From the Argentinian counter-attack, Messi surged forward from halfway to shoot wide.

Amid suffocating tension in extra-time, Chile had the best early chance to score in the 98th minute when he headed Edson Puch's cross only to be denied by Romero.

Aguero then drew a fine save from Bravo with a looping header.

After that there was little in the way of chances, leaving the game to hinge on the penalty shootout.

"I’ll be marked now, need to find new strategy every time, says Sindhu","Indian badminton ace P V Sindhu says she will be marked by opponents after her World Championships gold and would need to constantly discover “new things” in her game to maintain her stranglehold on international badminton.

Olympic silver medallist Sindhu became the first Indian to win a historic World Championships gold medal after thrashing Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 in a lop-sided final at Basel, Switzerland last month.

Asked about the challenges that she will face from now on, Sindhu, who boasts of two silver and as many bronze in the World Championships, said: “Pressure and responsibility will now be more. I know everybody will mark me now after the World Championship.

“Now I have to really work harder and change a few things and come with new things because everyone can see my game and know what I am playing. So I have to go with new strategy every time I go into the court,” Sindhu told reporters in New Delhi.

The 24-year-old from Hyderabad said the World Championships gold medal took a long time coming and it was a result of hard work, besides all the sacrifices that her parents have made over the years.

“I have been wanting this gold for five years. I have been losing every time. I also used to feel sad, but I always kept fighting back and working hard. My parents made a lot of sacrifices for me,” she said.

“Coaches role also has been important. My first coach was Mehboob Ali and then I have been under Gopi sir since I was 10. In badminton, you need to have a strong mindset.”

Sindhu will next play at the China Open World Tour Super 1000 (September 17-22) and Korea Open World Tour Super 500 (September 24-29) at Changzhou and Incheon City respectively.

“I am preparing for China and Korea Open, I will be leaving in a few days, that is my immediate goal. I hope to give my best,” she said on the sidelines of the PNB MetLife Junior Badminton Championship (JBC).

“This (gold) medal gave a big boost and I will move with this confidence. There are many events before Olympics, so I will just give 100 percent instead of taking pressure.”

Asked if there was any pressure ahead of the World Championships final, Sindhu said: “There was no pressure in the final. The quarterfinals was one of the good matches against Tai Tzu.

“Playing Okuhara, everyone was saying whether I will repeat the 2017 final but for me I was not thinking about that. It was a fresh match for me. We knew each others’ game, as we have played a lot against each other. So there was no particular strategy.”

National coach Pullela Gopichand had recently said that India have not “invested enough in coaches”.

Asked about her opinion on this issue, Sindhu said: “There needs to be high level coaches, where they need to know everything about badminton to create a champion.

“Of course, Gopi sir himself has been a great player and a great coach. Now we have other coaches from abroad and they are helping us. But national coaches need to be much qualified, then definitely they can train more players and they will become champions.”

Talking about the role of foreign coach Kim Ji Hyun of Korea, Sindhu said: “For last couple of months, I have been training with Kim under the guidance of Gopi sir. It is not just one stroke, each stroke is important, we have to make each stroke perfect.

“We have been working on defence and front and back court and that really helped me.”

Sindhu, who felicitated the winners of PNB MetLife Junior Badminton Championship (JBC), also gave a big thumbs-up to the tournament which completed its fifth edition here on Tuesday.

“It is a great idea and it is encouraging players of grassroot level. The number of participants is increasing and talent is there and we need to have tournaments like this for them to grow,” she said.

“PNB Metlife is encouraging and supporting each of them.”

Trump to lead task force preparing for 2026 World Cup,"President Donald Trump created a task force Friday (March 7, 2025) to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which will bring the globe's premier football tournament to North America at a time when his on-again, off-again tariffs have ratcheted up tensions across the continent.

“I think it's going to make it more exciting,” Mr. Trump said of playing the World Cup amid sharp rhetoric between leaders of the host nations. “Tension's a good thing.”

The task force, which Mr. Trump will chair, will coordinate the federal government's security and planning for the tournament, which is expected to draw millions of tourists to the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“It's a great honour for our country to have it,” Mr. Trump said of the World Cup after meeting with officials from FIFA, the international football governing body. He said he'd like to attend multiple games.

Preparations are ramping up across the continent alongside tensions between the United States and its neighbours as Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs before backing off, spooking markets and leading to fears of a trade war and economic downturn. He also speaks pejoratively of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and muses about Canada becoming a US state, which has boosted national pride north of the border.

For 2026, the World Cup will expand to 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations, the first time the tournament will be split between countries. Seventy-eight of 104 matches will be played in the US, with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada, and as many as six matches a day. The final will be played July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the task force will ensure that each of the visitors who will travel from around the world “feels safe, feels happy and feels that we are doing something special.”

“So we're here to create and to make the best show on the planet ever,” Mr. Infantino said. He gave Mr. Trump a personalised game ball and unveiled an elaborate trophy that will go to the winner of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, which will pit top football clubs against each other this summer ahead of next year's matchup of national teams.

Mr. Trump later brought Infantino to show off the trophy at the start of a White House cryptocurrency summit. The United States, where football has grown in popularity but remains a niche sport, represents a major growth area for football, he said.

Mr. Infantino likened producing the World Cup to holding three Super Bowls daily for a month, a dizzying security and logistical challenge for the host governments.

The Trump administration will face a second test on the global sports stage in 2028, when the summer Olympics will be held in California, the first time the Games will have been in the US since Salt Lake City hosted in 2002.

Life insurance companies to discuss SEBI order,"Against the backdrop of Securities and Exchange Board of India banning 14 life insurers from selling unit linked insurance products (ULIPs), the insurers are likely to meet here on Monday to examine various options open to them for relief against the order.

SEBI had, on Friday, banned 14 life insurance companies from selling ULIPs on the ground that they were akin to mutual funds and were launched without obtaining registration from it.

The insurance companies are likely to meet the Life Insurance Council on Monday to examine the various options including legal to counter the SEBI order.

The market regulator has banned 14 insurers — ICICI Prudential Life, Bharti AXA Life, Reliance Life, Aviva Life Bajaj Allianz Life, Birla Sun Life, Metlife Insurance, Tata AIG Life, Aegon Religare, HDFC Standard, Kotak Life, Max New York Life, ING Vyasa Life and SBI Life, from selling ULIPs. There is also speculation that SEBI would issue show casue notices to LIC and a few other life insurers for not seeking its approval before launching their ULIPs. SEBI has ordered all the 14 companies not to issue any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money by way of new and/or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from it.

SEBI had issued notices to these life insurers on January 15 except HDFC Standard Life, which was issued notice in December last, asking why they had not obtained permission from it before launching ULIPs. SEBI's contention is that ULIPs offered by the life insurers are a combination of investment and insurance and, therefore, the investment component is in the nature of mutual funds which can only be offered or launched after obtaining registration from SEBI.

Life insurers said that they have not yet received the SEBI order. Reacting to the SEBI's notice, insurance sector regulator, IRDA, said that ULIPs offered by different insurance companies are safe and secure and “the matter arising out of the recent orders of the SEBI would be addressed expeditiously in an appropriate forum in accordance with law.”

FIFA to pay $1 billion prize money for Club World Cup: source,"FIFA will pay total prize money of one billion dollars to participants in the Club World Cup taking place in the United States this year, a source close to negotiations told AFP on Wednesday.

The figure is significantly more than the prize money offered for either the last men's or women's World Cups.

World football's governing body has given few details about the funding of the first edition of the 32-team tournament that will take place every four years but it has signed up a broadcaster and major sponsors in recent weeks.

British streaming service DAZN was awarded the exclusive global rights to the June 14-July 13 tournament in December with a source close to the negotiations saying the contract was worth around one billion euros ($1.05 billion).

FIFA has also signed sponsorship contracts with Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Chinese electronics brand Hisense and Belgian brewers AB InBev.

By comparison the total prize money for the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar was $440 million, while for the 2023 Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia it was $110 million.

This season's UEFA Champions League, with a new 36-club format, will pay a total 2.47 billion euros ($2.66 billion) to the clubs involved.

FIFA's expansion of the tournament has been met by widespread criticism, especially in Europe, largely due to concerns over player welfare.

The global footballers' union FIFPro and the European Leagues association filed a complaint with the European Commission in October against FIFA, accused of abusing its dominant position by packing the calendar.

The Champions League was also expanded by UEFA this season and some players, including Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, have raised the prospect of a strike.

""I think we are close to that. I think if you ask any player he will say the same,"" said Rodri when asked in September if there was a possibility of players going on strike, shortly before suffering a season-ending knee injury.

""It is not the opinion of Rodri or whatever. I think it's the general opinion of the players.""

The tournament will feature 12 teams from Europe, six from South America and four each from Asia, Africa and North and Central America.

Auckland City and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami complete the line-up.

Not all the reaction has been negative, with Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique insisting ""everyone"" would want to play.

""Once every four years there's this new, extremely exciting competition. Everyone wants to go to the Club World Cup,"" he said last year.

The tournament will be held at 12 venues across 11 cities in the United States, with the final at the MetLife Stadium, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final, in New Jersey.

Ed Sheeran to return to India for ‘+ - = ÷ x Tour’ in 2024,"British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is coming back to India and this time, it’s for his ‘+ - = ÷ x’ tour. The India leg of the tour will be the final stop in the Asia Tour and will be held at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse in the heart of Mumbai on March 16th, 2024. Fellow British singer and songwriter Calum Scott will be the special guest on the upcoming tour.

The new tour will mark Sheeran’s return to India six years after his outing with the ‘Divide’ Tour in 2017. This comes hot on the heels of his USA tour, where he set multiple attendance records including Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium and New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium; the latter seeing Sheeran secure the largest single-day concert attendance in the USA, ever. Earlier this year, the four-time Grammy Award-winning artist released two albums, ‘Subtract’ and ‘Autumn Variations’.

The upcoming tour will also mark Sheeran’s return to Asia after 2019. Sheeran’s two-hour ‘+ - = ÷ x’ Tour will draw from all of his albums since 2011 – ‘Plus’, ‘Multiply’ (2014), ‘Divide’ (2017), ‘Equals’ (2021) and the new ‘Subtract’, and also includes a song from 2019’s ‘No. 6 Collaborations Project (‘Blow’).

The general on-sale of tickets will go live at 3 pm IST on October 27 on BookMyShow and Ed Sheeran’s website.

"Northwest Hyderabad leads real estate boom with ₹71,926 crore sales in 2024","Hyderabad’s real estate market witnessed the sale of 65,177 residential units amounting to a total value of ₹ 1.13 lakh crore, according to data revealed by CREDAI Hyderabad in collaboration with CRE Matrix on Tuesday.

According to the report, Northwest Hyderabad emerged as the dominant market, accounting for nearly 70% of total unit sales. The region, which includes Madhapur, Miyapur, Manikonda, Serilingampally, Tellapur, Narsingi, Patancheru and Gandi Maisamma recorded sales of 45,405 units valued at ₹ 71,926 crore.

Southwest Hyderabad followed, with 9,109 units sold in areas near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Katedan, Attapur and Balapur. The total value of homes sold in this region was ₹29,342 crore.

In contrast, eastern parts of Hyderabad recorded comparatively lower sales. Northeast Hyderabad, which includes Tirumalgiri, Alwal, parts of Secunderabad, Cherlapalli, Dammaiguda and Boduppal saw 6,279 units sold totalling ₹ 7,147 crore. Southeast Hyderabad recorded the lowest sales figures with 4,384 units sold for a total value of ₹ 5,522 crore. This region includes LB Nagar, Dilsukhnagar, Vanasthalipuram and Pedda Amberpet.

“The focus for long has been on the western part of Hyderabad. The government now needs to look east and focus on development there. When the policymakers start moving east, developers will automatically move there. The extreme focus on the western part of Hyderabad has also contributed to growing traffic congestion, as a majority of people are both living and working in that part of the city,” said V. Rajashekar Reddy, President of CREDAI Hyderabad.

The report also highlighted trends in the commercial real estate sector. In terms of office space, a demand of 13 million square feet was created, compared to a supply of 12.4 million square feet. The top office transactions included Google leasing 5.5 lakh square feet at Elegans Emperia, followed by Metlife Services East taking 1.5 lakh square feet at Prestige Skypark, HCA Global Services leasing 1.09 lakh square feet at Salarpuria Knowledge Park and Cigna leasing 1.06 lakh square feet at the same location.

Among developers, the Phoenix Group led the market with a 70% share, followed by Pranava Group at 17% and Modi Realty at 13%. IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) remained the dominant demand drivers, accounting for 49% of commercial space uptake, followed by healthcare at 18%, BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance) at 10%, and the automobile sector at 8%.

“Hyderabad’s commercial real estate sector is undergoing rapid expansion, with total Grade A office stock reaching 151.1 million square feet and 82.9 million square feet currently under construction,” said Jagannath Rao Bandari, General Secretary of CREDAI Hyderabad.

Will achieve ambitious economic agenda by elections: Chidambaram,"Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has assured global investors that their concerns over India’s economy will be put to rest and the government will achieve its “ambitious economic agenda” by next year’s Lok Sabha elections.

“Global industry wants India to succeed. India will succeed. I know this past year has caused a lot of concern, but this year is over and by elections we will achieve our ambitious economic agenda,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Wednesday at a closed door meeting with investors hosted by the US-India Business Council (USIBC) in New York.

Mr. Chidambaram is currently touring US cities to attract foreign investment and sell India’s growth story to investors as India grapples with a high current account deficit.

“India currently holds a record high current account deficit and FDI could be the key to closing that gap,” USIBC said in a statement.

USIBC said top global industry leaders discussed with the Finance Minister the opportunities that exist in India and candidly addressed some of the challenges companies face in the market which affects investor sentiment.

The CEOs of Fortune 100 companies discussed a range of issues including infrastructure, retail, agriculture, life sciences, financial services, legal services, and real estate.

“We commend Minister Chidambaram for his leadership during these complex times. The American business community continues to look to India as a partner in the global economy ripe with investment opportunities.

“My colleagues and I remain committed to working collaboratively with Government of India and Indian industry to identify innovative solutions to India’s challenges,” USIBC Chairman and MasterCard president & CEO Ajay Banga said.

Among those were present at the USIBC meeting included PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, The McGraw Hill Companies President and CEO Harold McGraw Chairman, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Amway President Doug DeVos, President of Emerging Markets, Pfizer Olivier Brandicourt and MetLife CFO John Hele.

Founded in 1975, USIBC is a leading business advocacy association comprising nearly 400 of America’s and India’s top companies focused to enhancing the U.S.-India commercial relationship.

Merged PSBs must cut stake in insurers,"After the merger of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four, two of them will hold over 15% stake in two different insurance companies, individually.

According to insurance regulations, a bank cannot hold more than 15% stake in more than one insurance company.

“Having more than 15% stake in an insurance company gives the status of the promoter to the entity. One entity cannot be a promoter of two insurance companies,” a senior insurance industry official said. “So, the banks have to completely exit one insurance company or cut stake to 15%,” the official added. Two sets of merger-bound PSBs will hold stakes in two different insurance companies, post the merger. One is Punjab National-Oriental Bank of Commerce-United Bank of India combine and another is the Union Bank-Andhra Bank-Corporation Bank combine.

In the first combine both PNB and OBC hold stakes in two different insurers. PNB has a 30% stake in PNB Metlife Life India Insurance Company while OBC holds 23% in Canara-HSBC-OBC Life Insurance. So, the merged entity —  PNB — will hold over 15% stakes in both the  companies.

In the second combine, Union Bank holds 25% stake in Star Union Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Company while Andhra Bank holds 30% stake in India-First Life Insurance Company. So, the merged entity — Union Bank — will have more than 15%  in both the life insurers.

However, bank officials said they were not in a hurry to cut stake as that could impact valuations. Banks would wait for an initial public offering (IPO) to offload stakes.

“We are not in a hurry to sell stake. After the merger, when there is an IPO of one of the companies, we will reduce stake,” said a top official from one of the merger-bound banks.

Banks will have to get the permission of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) — the insurance regulator — for holding over 15% stake in two insurers for a while, that is, till the IPO. Bank mergers are expected to be completed by March 2020 and it is unlikely  insurers would like to hit the capital markets, especially when the markets are choppy.

Interestingly, PNB Metlife was planning an IPO last year but postponed its plans due to market conditions.

OBC had also been planning to divest stake in Canara-HSBC-OBC Life Insurance last year but the plan was shelved.

IDBI Bank, in which LIC has a majority stake, also has an insurance arm in IDBI-Federal Life Insurance  in which it holds 48% stake.

The bank has now started the process of exiting the life insurance company.

Lionel Messi retires from international football,"Ace footballer Lionel Messi on Monday announced retirement from International Football after Argentina's loss in Copa America final.

Chile stunned Argentina to win the Copa America Centenario in a penalty shootout as Messi's title curse struck again.

Messi, a five-time FIFA player of the year, winner of four Champions League titles and eight Spanish La Liga crowns with Barcelona, was crushed. Much of his nation had counted on him to bring home its first major title since 1993.

Playing two days after his 29th birthday, Messi lost a final for the third year in a row and the fourth time overall with Argentina.

A crowd of 82,076 filled MetLife Stadium the largest to see a soccer game in New Jersey and many wore his No. 10 jersey in Argentina’s blue and white and Barcelona’s navy and red.

""For me the national team is over. I've done all I can, it hurts not to be a champion,"" the 29-year-old Barcelona superstar told reporters after his fourth defeat in a major final with Argentina.

"Copa America semifinal: Lionel Messi will start against Canada, says Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni","Lionel Messi won't be stopped by a leg injury and will play in Argentina's Copa America semifinal against Canada on July 9 night.

Messi has been dealing with a right leg problem since the group stage win over Chile on June 25. He missed the first-round finale four days later but played the entire match in the quarterfinal victory over Ecuador last Thursday.

""Leo is good. He will be playing tomorrow,” Albiceleste coach Lionel Scaloni said Monday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

At 37, Messi has 13 Copa America goals and is four behind the record shared by Argentina's Norberto Méndez and Brazil's Zizinho but hasn't scored in this year's tournament.

“It's an easy decision for me,” Scaloni said. “It's a fairly honest decision: I ask him how he feels. If he says I'm not good,' then he will play the last 30 minutes. When he's available, he will play.” 	Seeking a record 16th Copa America title, Argentina beat Canada 2-0 in the June 20 tournament opener when Messi set up second-half goals by Julián Álvarez and Lautaro Martínez.

“We didn't do well enough with Messi last match. He was able to run free at our goalkeeper too much,"" said Jesse Marsch, the American hired as Canada's coach in May. “We all know he's the greatest player to ever play the game.” 	Argentina outshot Canada 19-10, including 9-2 on target, and had 64% possession.

“It's more of (an) advantage that we were able to play against them than it was for them to play against us,” Marsch said.

Both teams are coming off quarterfinal wins on penalty kicks. Canada, an invited guest from North America, defeated Venezuela.

In the other semifinal, Uruguay plays Colombia on Wednesday night in Charlotte, North Carolina. The championship is Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.

Argentina will have four days' rest, one more than Canada, but both teams are coming off 90-minute matches. Tournament regulations call for extra time to be used only if needed in the final.

Argentina is seeking to win its third major title after the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup and to equal the feat of Spain, which won the European Championship in 2008 and '12 along with the 2010 World Cup. The Albiceleste are tied with Uruguay for most Copa America titles with 15.

Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has won four straight shootouts, against Colombia in the 2021 Copa semifinals, vs. the Netherlands in the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals and against France in the final, then vs. Ecuador last week.

Martinez, 6-foot-5, constantly shuffling his feet and a chatterbox trying to distract opponents, saved eight of 18 shots, stopping Colombia's Davinson Sánchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona; the Netherlands' Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis; France's Kingsley Coman; and Ecuador's Ángel Mena and Alan Minda.

Canada was eliminated in the group stage of its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022. It won the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup after gaining the title of a predecessor tournament, the 1985 CONCACAF Championship.

“We're playing against the best team in the world,” said Cyle Larin, Canada's career leader with 29 goals. “We have a lot of speed and power, but I think over those days we've been together we've been growing.”

Insurance repositories focus on  transactions for revenue,"The revenue model of the newly licensed insurance repositories will be based on the number of transactions done. The repositories will be charging the insurance firms for each transaction done according to Viiveck Verma, Executive Director, Karvy Insurance Repository Limited.

Karvy was one among the five firms licensed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to be the insurance repositories. The rest four are, NSDL Database management Limited, Central Insurance Repository Limited, SHCIL Projects Limited and CAMS Repository Services Limited.

“There are over 42 crore policy holders in life and health insurance segments. We are ready with the best infrastructure possible to facilitate electronic services and transactions. Our unique selling point is our mobile platform for wider reach,” Viiveck said. As per T.S Vijayan, Chairman IRDA, the transaction charge by repositories could be around Rs 25.

The management cost of each policy is expected to come down from Rs. 120 per policy to Rs. 25 per annum according to Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram who inaugurated the repositories in Hyderabad. The system enables policy holders buy and keep insurance policies in electronic form and eliminate paper and associated risks. The repositories will be paid directly by the insurers and policy holders are not charged.

This apart, the system enables customers take an informed decision according to Dr. Amarnath Ananthanarayanan, CEO & MD of Bharti AXA General Insurance Company Limited. “Customers can compare and evaluate the mutual funds and insurance policies and take a view through the system,” he said.

The insurance firms, on their part, have already started acting on the expected changes in the system. “We have already tied up with all the five players and started offering digital options to customers. We are ready with digital database and digital stamp,” said Rajesh Relan, MD and Country manager, PNB MetLife India. Repository system requires customers open an electronic Insurance Account (eIA) with the repository.

"Deepika spills beans on Hollywood project, IIFA performance","It's a big night for Deepika Padukone at the IIFA awards function on Saturday. She's nervous as not only is this her first performance for the season, but what adds to the stress is that she will be dancing to her songs from                         Bajirao Mastani         and seated among the audience will be her director Sanjay Leela Bhansali who is flying in all the way from India to see this.

Deepika has been making news for her projects in the west. Fans and media are curious to know why she would not be giving us any Bollywood release this year and why will it be only a Hollywood flick                         xXx: The Return of Xander Cage        .

""For me I do not treat a film as coming from Hollywood or Bollywood. It's the script I read first. I need to know if I will love doing it and it’s only after that I take up roles. I will take up roles when they excite me or when I am ready. This experience is special for me and I am very excited about it.""

I prod further and ask her how different or similar are two industries and she is quick to answer. ""Wow I was waiting for someone to ask me this. If I have to say I did not miss anything at all and the only thing that was different was the location then you will realise as a film industry where we stand. The journey of Indian cinema has been amazing. The growth be it technically, content, or in the films we are on par with Hollywood. It was so comforting to know I did not miss anything.""

Personally however, there were many firsts shooting in the west. Staying by herself in an apartment, cooking meals and doing her laundry, Deepika loved each part of this. From taking her candles and photo frames to cooking meals be it                         rasam         or                         sambar         she enjoyed it all. ""There were many Indian restaurants in Toronto so finding North Indian food was not a problem so I cooked my sambar and rasam. I would ask people coming to visit me to bring me pre mixes and masala packets,"" she adds.

Coming back to IIFA she admits that though it's her first time in Madrid she loves Spain.

"" I am loving it. Music, love, warmth, food, generosity...There so many similarities between the two countries and it's a good way to showcase what we are doing with our movies,"" she adds.

IIFA awards: A green carpet welcome,"Temperatures soared slightly higher than usual at Madrid last night as the green carpet was taken over by sizzling hot celebrities who walked down the carpet for the technical awards.

SEBI bans 14 insurance companies from raising money for ULIP,"Market regulator SEBI on Friday night banned 14 major private insurance companies, including SBI Life, ICICI Prudential and Tata AIG, from raising money from public for any Unit Linked Insurance Products (ULIP).

While passing the order late Friday, SEBI said the entities have not obtained any registration from the regulator though the ULIPs launched by them had an investment component in the nature of mutual funds.

“I hereby direct the entities...not to issue any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money from investors by way of new or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from SEBI,” said Prashant Saran, wholetime SEBI member in an order.

The other insurance companies against whom SEBI passed an order are Aegon Religare Life, Aviva Life, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla Sunlife, HDFC Standard Life, ING Vysya Life, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life, Max New York Life, Metlife India and Reliance Life.

The order said ULIPs launched by the insurance companies were prima facie found to be akin to the mutual fund schemes.

While the SEBI regulates mutual funds and their schemes, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) oversees functioning of insurance companies.

Worthy of biopics,"If biopics are to be believed, reality, with all its vicissitudes, beats imagination. Indian cinema has of late thrown its door open to an array of biopics of men and women with remakable lives for audiences to relive. Mahanati, which released this week, based on Savitri’s life, narrated the making of a genius, and the unfurling of a tragedy.

NTR and Chiranjeevi, are two other names whose biopics will get a red carpet at the box office when they happen. Also in the making is Yatra, a biopic on the former chief minister Y S Rajasekhar Reddy.

Biopics are also being proposed on severalsportspersons like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, and their coach Pullela Gopichand. Dhyan Chand, Mithali Raj and Abhinav Bindra are some other names whose stories have attracted auteurs.

Mary Kom and Milkha Singh have proven that India is a treasure trove of attractive stories (too bad Hollywood beat us to Ramanujam’s tale — again a brilliant story outside sports that has twists and turns which can put the most imaginative fiction to shame). In fact, we are only scraping the surface when it comes to inspirational tales that can be adopted for the silver screen. Here are a few names from the distant and the not-so-distant past that could keep the genre of biopics afloat for long. .

Potti Sreeramulu



Chiranjeevi’s                         Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy         turns the spotlight on revolutionaries from this part of the country. ‘Amarajeevi’ Potti Sreeramulu, one of Gandhi’s favourite followers, who went on a hunger strike to persuade the Indian government to form a separate state for the Telugu-speaking population under the Madras Presidency. His death due to fasting led to the declaration of a separate Andhra Pradesh State. Earlier too, Sreeramulu had fasted several times in favour of Dalit rights, a subject that is still relevant today.

Tanguturi Prakasam





A sobriquet like ‘Andhra Kesari’ reveals a lot about Andhra’s first chief minister. Tanguturi Prakasham ‘Pantulu’was a successful lawyer and freedom fighter known for his bravado.  he didn’t shirk from taking on even the likes of Nehru and Gandhi. His political life was a roller-coaster and his story has everything — revolution, reforms, debates, ego clashes and the rise-fall-rise pattern of great lives.

The first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal — do we need a greater reason for the story of this weightlifter to be told? For someone hailing from a small village like Voosavanipeta in Srikakulam, the journey to world glory in a sport like weightlifting is a tale for the generations. Her greatness lies in the fact that the Olympic medal was just one in a long list of achievements, including a gold in the World Weightlifting Championships.

The ‘Mozart of Madras’ and one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in 2009, AR Rahman, in his glittering career has won everything — the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and the Grammy, not to mention six National Awards. As his title ‘Isai Puyal’ (music storm) suggests, the great man broke onto the scene in his 20s with the genre-bending OST for Roja and Indian music was never the same. Who wouldn’t want to see his story on screen?

This for a man made to wait for decades to enter some famous temples, owing to his religion, is nothing but a triumph for music. A student of several illustrious greats of Carnatic music, Yesudas, despite financial constraints, rose up to the stature of Gana Gandharvan, recording 80,000 songs over half a century in more than half a dozen languages.

25000 concerts in a career which started when he was all of six isn’t even the most astounding fact about the great maestro, known not just for his excellence in Carnatic music but for enriching it further with new ragas and an innovative tala system that he created.  If we need a biopic sans drama, just to feel good reminiscing the remarkable achievements of a great man, made Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 2005, this is the story to behold.

In a cricket crazy country, the story of the first captain of the Indian cricket team in Tests is definitely one of interest. Hailed by historians including Ramachandra Guha, Nayudu, a real-life Bhuvan (think                         Lagaan        ) probably captured the imagination of a country with his scintillating knock of 153 in 116 minutes for the Hindus against the MCC Team in the Bombay Gymkhana Grounds. That innings in 1926 probably led to India’s elevation to Test status way before Independence and cricket’s rise in the nation.

        If you had loved the critically acclaimed                         127 Hours        , you are bound to find the story of Malli Mastan Babu, who hailed from Nellore, inspiring. After an impressive educational record (an M Tech from IIT Kharagpur and an MBA from IIM Calcutta), Mastan Babu pursued his passion for mountaineering, creating a world record in 2006, as the then fastest Seven Summiteer (climbing the highest mountain peak in each continent, known as Seven Summits, in just 172 days). Bad weather in the Andes led to his tragic demise, at the age of 41, during one of his solo missions.

Spain joins forces with Bollywood to boost tourism,"Spain is coaxing Indian moviemakers to use its colourful fiestas and historic monuments as settings for their films, in a move to grab a bigger share of India's fast-growing overseas tourism market.

As part of its bid to lure visitors from India Madrid will host next weekend the annual International Indian Film Academy awards (IIFA), dubbed the ""Bollywood Oscars"".

In global tourism, Spain ranks as the third most visited country, but it now wants to diversify its tourism base beyond the traditional northern European sunseekers that account for the bulk of its visitors.

Among the Bollywood stars who will attend the awards ceremony in Spain will be actor Hrithik Roshan, the star of the 2011 coming-of-age movie                         Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara        , which was produced in close collaboration with the Spanish tourism promotion agency, Turespana.

The film about three friends on a pre-marriage road trip across Spain includes scenes at the ‘La Tomatina’ festival in the town of Bunol as well as at Pamplona's San Fermin bull running festival.

With scenes also set in Barcelona, Seville and the beaches of the Costa Brava, the movie was the first major Indian production to shoot extensively in various locations in Spain.

It was also the highest grossing Bollywood film of 2011.

""There was an immediate impact in the number of people requesting entry visas to travel to Spain,"" the director of the London office of Turespana, Enrique Ruiz de Lera, who led the agency's talks with the producers of the movie, told AFP.

The year after its release, 60,444 Indians visited Spain, nearly double the 2011 figure, according to the industry and tourism ministry. Last year 85,000 Indians visited Spain.

Lonely Planet in 2013 launched a guide to Spain aimed specifically at the Indian market and travel agencies still advertise tours to the locations featured in                         Zindagi..        .

India's ambassador to Spain, Vikram Misri, said the film ""was singlehandedly responsible for making Spain a household name in India and increasing tourism from India"".

Cruise ship movie

Turespana suggested locations for filming but gave no direct financial aid to cover the cost of making the movie, Ruiz de Lera said.

Instead it helped secure permits to film at key sites and negotiate deals on hotel rooms and transportation for the crew to lower production costs. ""We helped a lot with contacts so filming in Spain was easy,"" Ruiz de Lera said.

In return, the producers of the film agreed to include a short advertisement before the start of the movie promoting Spain by award-winning Spanish director Julio Medem.

Spain and India signed a film co-production agreement the year after                         Zindagi…         was released.

Turespana regularly takes part in film location fairs in India to pitch the tax breaks and other incentives available to movie producers who shoot in Spain.

Since                         Zindagi...        , another ""five or six"" Indian films have been shot in Spain although none was as popular at the box office, the director of the Mumbai office of Turespana, Ignacio Ducasse, told AFP.

They include one by                         Zindagi…         director Zoya Akhtar —                         Dil Dhadakne Do         featuring actor Anil Kapoor — which was filmed on a ship belonging to Pullmantur, Spain's biggest cruise operator.

The comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family on a 10-day Mediterranean cruise was released last year and it includes scenes shot in Barcelona as well as in the various bars, restaurants and open decks of the ship.

Stars in ad campaign

Kapoor, 59, best known internationally for his role in the 2008 film                         Slumdog Millionaire        , said during a visit to Madrid in March to promote IIFA that he is ""looking forward to coming back again and again to Spain"".

Tourism is crucial for the Spanish economy, accounting for around 11 percent of gross domestic product and one in nine jobs, according to the tourism ministry. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation predicts India will account for 50 million outbound tourists by 2020, up from just 18 million in 2014.

Turespana plans to create an ad campaign to appeal to this rising tide of tourists using images of Bollywood celebrities enjoying themselves in Madrid at the awards show. The ceremony itself is expected to bring 15,000 visitors to the Spanish capital during the week of the show.

""We are counting that the arrival of several thousand Indian friends for the (awards) ceremony will help bring millions of their compatriots in the coming years,"" Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs, Ignacio Ybanez, said earlier this year.

Sindhu hopes to turn the tide in upcoming tournaments this month,"Olympic silver medallist P V Sindhu on Thursday admitted that her season so far has not been “great” but expressed hope of turning the tide in the upcoming events, beginning with Indonesia Open from July 16.

Sindhu has played in six tournaments so far this year without reaching a final. She reached the semifinals in India Open in March and Singapore Open in April.

“(It) has not been really great. But, it was ok. I am satisfied. But, I think I have to do much better,” Sindhu told reporters on the sidelines of PNB Metlife announcing the launch of Junior Badminton Championship-5.

Asked what went wrong in the last six months during which she did not win any major tournament, Sindhu said, “Nothing went wrong. But on the day, sometimes, you might not just give your 100 per cent. Sometimes, you might just make too many mistakes.

“That’s why I said I have to be satisfied. It’s not that I am happy. But, you always have to think that there is always a next time,” she said.

The 23-year-old Sindhu said she has worked hard on her game during the one month-long break she got and is confident of doing well in Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.

“We have got almost one month of break. I have been in my top level and working hard. There has been enough time to prepare for the next three tournaments, that is Indonesia, Japan and Thailand. So, I am confident that I can do well and I can give my 100 per cent,” said the 2016 Olympics silver medallist.

The Indonesia Open begins on July 16 while Japan Open and Thailand Open will start on July 23 and July 30.

During the break, she said she has worked on her physical and mental fitness to be in good shape.

“I have worked on mental as well as physical (fitness). Matches have been really long nowadays. Everything is like a chain where you need to touch up on everything. It’s not just that you do physical and leave the skill part. I think I have been working out on skill a lot more,” she said.

“Because, now the game has changed a lot. A lot of people have been working out on their skills and physical. I think it is very important to keep yourself fit as well as in your skill work, you need to be very much perfect as well. So, I have been working on that,” she said when asked if she worked on something new.

She said the players need to have variation in their game to achieve success in major tournaments.

“Every time, we need to change. Because, it is not the same every time. Not only you, your opponents change their game,” she said.

“Now, there are video cameras, there are videos, analysing and doing everything. Even though we go with one strategy, when you go on to court, every point can be comparatively different. That’s what I feel,” she added.

Sindhu said her training with new coaches, who have come a few of months ago, has been good. She is currently training with Korean Kim Ji Hyun and hoped that it would work well for her.

The players can learn new techniques from every coach as each one has different thinking and experience, she said.

Sindhu said each tournament is important for her though she aimed to win a medal in the Tokyo Olympics next year.

"The economic impact of the first leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour | Explained
Premium","The story so far: On August 31, U.S. musician Taylor Swift announced that her spectacular Eras Tour will premiere as a three-hour movie across theatres in North America on October 13. The tour, currently in its second leg in South America, will travel to Europe and a few spots in Asia before returning to North America in 2024.

It is already being touted as the biggest concert tour ever by a musician, predicted to oust the likes of John Lennon, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay.

Ms. Swift first announced 27 shows on November 1, 2022, across 20 cities in the U.S. However, unprecedented public demand led her to expand the first leg of the tour across the U.S. to 53 shows, with the maximum number of shows (six) at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

She played the first show in Glendale, Arizona on March 17; it was temporarily renamed “Swift City” by Mayor Jerry Weiers in her honour.

Other cities also followed suit – Pittsburgh became Swiftsburgh, Minneapolis became Swiftie-apolis, and Santa Clara was renamed Swiftie Clara. Ms. Swift was also named the honorary mayor of Santa Clara.

QuestionPro, a U.S.-based survey software company, estimates that the Eras Tour could generate $5 billion in economic impact for the U.S. economy – more than the GDP of 50 countries across the world.

                                QuestionPro data

The record for the highest-grossing music tour of all time currently belongs to Elton John who, according to Billboard, capped off his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour in July 2023 with $939 million.

When Ms. Swift first announced her tour, Billboard predicted that it could generate more than $300 million. Since then, she almost doubled the number of shows in the U.S. during the first leg and announced international dates for South America, Europe, and Asia.

According to Pollstar, Ms. Swift’s Eras Tour has already surpassed the 2023 collection of the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which started in 2018 and took a break during the COVID-19 pandemic years.

Tickets for Ms. Swift’s Eras Tour shows in the U.S. ranged from $49 to $449, while VIP packages cost $199 to $899. According to Pollstar, the average ticket price for the show was $253.56.

Tickets on resale websites, however, raked in thousands of dollars. Ticketmaster, the official online ticket seller for the Eras Tour, crashed when people first queued up virtually to buy tickets, eventually prompting a Senate hearing over concerns of monopoly of concert ticket sales.

In a statement, the company said that over 3.5 million people registered for the presale. “Historically, around 40% of invited fans actually show up and buy tickets, and most purchase an average of 3 tickets. Around 1.5 million people were sent codes to join the onsale for all 52 show dates, including the 47 sold by Ticketmaster. The remaining 2 million were placed on a waiting list,” Ticketmaster said.

The company received 3.5 billion total system requests, four times its previous peak. “Never before has a Verified Fan onsale sparked so much attention – or traffic. This disrupted the predictability and reliability that is the hallmark of our Verified Fan platform,” the statement added.

Ticketmaster sold over two million tickets for the Eras Tour on November 15 — the most for an artist on a single day.

The non-availability of tickets is a possible reason for exorbitant resale prices.  According to TicketIQ, an event ticket search engine, the average listing price of tickets for the Eras Tour when it was first announced was $2,183 on the secondary market.

QuestionPro research also suggests that the average attendee spent around $1,300 per show on tickets, merchandise, food and drinks, costumes, travel and other expenses. Around 49% of attendees had household income of less than $50,000, while 25% each fall in the $50,000-$100,000 and over $100,000 categories.

Most of the Eras Tour shows were sold out, with many tailgating outside venues hoping for resale tickets— calling it “Taylorgating” or “Taygating” after the singer. Stadiums like MetLife in East Rutherford and Gillette in Foxborough specifically asked tailgaters to not hinder traffic and ticket holders.

The average attendance of Eras Tour concerts was 53,900 according to Pollstar; while CNN, quoting QuestionPro data, said that around 72,459 attended each show on an average.

Ms. Swift broke multiple attendance records during the first U.S. leg of the Eras Tour. In Glendale, she recorded an attendance of over 140,000 people – almost the double of the Super Bowl event held in the same stadium in February 2023.

According to the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, she became the first-ever artist to perform three straight nights for an attendance record of 210,607.

She also set the record for biggest all-time Nissan Stadium concert attendance record for two nights in a row (since broken by singer Ed Sheeran).

Ms. Swift then went on to set to host record-breaking shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford and Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.

The Eras Tour drove businesses in the cities on its circuit, giving local economies a much-needed boost since COVID-19. According to Smith Travel Research (STR) reports, hotels in Eras Tour stops were “bejewelled”, with its impact, with around $208 million in additional U.S. hotel room revenue. This estimate  only records the impact of the concert nights and does not account for extended fan stays and other offshoots.

Pittsburgh and Nashville specifically doubled their revenue per available room (RevPAR) from shoulder weeks. Seattle, which led all host cities in absolute RevPAR ($293), broke its own record on July 22 (the first night of the Eras Tour in the city) with a RevPAR of $317.

Average daily rates (ADR) of concert days ranged from as high as $307 in Seattle to $138 in Houston, STR research said. ADR premiums, however, varied based on the normal seasonal patterns of the markets. Most markets made the best of the opportunity with double-digit ADR gains as the norm, led by Pittsburgh with a 70% increase followed by Nashville with a 51% increase.

The contribution of Ms. Swift’s tour to the hotel industry was also noted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the pandemic started, “in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city,” the bank noted in an official statement.

Chicago also noted a boom in hotel revenues. According to local reports, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced at a press conference that the State’s hotel revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30 reached $309 million. The pre-pandemic 2019 record was set at $296 million. This was in part due to the Eras Tour as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting and the James Bear Foundation awards in the city.

The Holiday Inn hotel in Glendale was sold out the day the Eras Tour was announced, Business Insider reported, quoting a representative. Other hotels in the vicinity of the State Farm Stadium were also booked to capacity, while the ones that weren’t were available for exorbitant prices, the report added.

Downtown Cincinnati, where Ms. Swift played two shows on June 30 and July 1, registered more than $2.6 million in hotel revenue for just two days, Visit Cincy reported. Hamilton County, situated at a 20-minute drive from Paycor Stadium where Ms. Swift performed, garnered $5.3 million in the same time period.

“The economic impact Ms. Swift creates is staggering, as fans travel from far and wide to attend her concerts, filling hotels, restaurants, and local attractions Swift’s influence on tourism is a testament to her ability to captivate audiences and drive economic growth,” said Julie Calvert, President and CEO of Visit Cincy. Even the tailgate party at The Banks in Cincinnati registered a footfall of 40,691, the report added.

Friendship bracelets are considered an integral part of the Swiftie experience, and concert attendees also contributed with their creativity.

Michaels, a multi-city American retail chain for craft supplies  (also celebrating its 50th anniversary this year), saw a more than 40% increase in the jewellery category, which includes jewellery-making kits and materials for friendship bracelets, since mid-April, the company informed The Hindu.

In cities where Ms. Swift performed, Michaels noted a whopping 300% increase in sales in categories like beads and jewellery on days leading up to the concerts. Pennsylvania saw the largest jewellery category sales increase among all States – 500% – thanks to  two stops, in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The largest single-stop sales increase was noted to be at more than 400% in Detroit, the store said.

“While we couldn’t have anticipated the trend would take off quite the way it did, our merchandising team was quick to identify it, anticipate what our customers would need, and ensure our stores were well stocked. We also began offering bracelet-making as part of our in-store classes and events, and saw our store teams tap into their own creativity to build special bracelet-making displays that engaged customers,” the company said in a statement.

More than 22,000 bracelets were reportedly made as part of the in-store classes. “We saw a large increase in demand for supplies for all kinds of creative projects during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this was the first instance in recent memory we’ve seen demand spike so acutely around a specific pop culture event and product category,” the statement added.

Bead World, a supplies store in Seattle, said that they registered the highest sales in their 34-year history in July before Ms. Swift was to perform in the city, a local media report said.

While the 2023 U.S. leg of the Eras Tour might be over, there is more to come. The concert movie will be released across theatres in North America on October 13. The announcement was made on August 31 by Ms. Swift on her social media accounts, and people rushed to buy tickets, setting a record for the highest-ever single-day advance ticket sales revenue in the 103-year history of AMC Theatres. The ticket sale generated $26 million in revenue in a day, breaking the previous record of $16.9 million, held by Tom Holland and Zendaya starrer Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Ms. Swift will now continue the Eras Tour in November 2023 with shows in Argentina and Brazil, before going to Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Europe, and then circling back to North America in late 2024.

The Eras Tour also drove up application for United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s credit cards in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam by 45% in July compared to the previous month, Bloomberg reported. The bank’s cardholders were eligible for an exclusive presale of Ms. Swift’s concert tickets.

Hotels in Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Cardiff, where the singer is scheduled to play in June and August 2024, are already sold out, TheGuardian reported, quoting Travelodge.

IRDA asks insurance companies to ignore SEBI order,"Insurance regulator IRDA has taken SEBI head on by setting aside a ban on ULIP by the market watchdog and asking 14 life insurance companies to continue their business as usual.

The finance ministry has opted to keep a safe distance from the ongoing controversy.

Unit-linked equity products (ULIPs) are insurance plans sold by life insurers where the money collected from consumers is invested into equity and debt markets and returns are linked to the same. Regulation of ULIPs has a bone of contention between the two regulators.

Moving swiftly within 24 hours of SEBI order, IRDA Chairman J Hari Narayan in a signed order has asserted that it is IRDA which will control the ULIPs, which are issued by the insurance companies.

Earlier on Friday, SEBI had banned 14 life insurance companies, including those belonging to the Tatas, Reliance Anil Ambani Group, SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC, from issuing ULIP products.

SEBI Chairman C.B. Bhave while speaking to reporters in Kolkata on Saturday declined to speak on the ban on 14 insurance companies from selling ULIP without its approval.

“I am not going to comment on the order,” he had said.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its Friday evening order had also said that entities registered with SEBI could operate such schemes as they are in the nature of mutual funds.

Even as the two regulators continue the turf war, Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla distanced himself from the controversy saying it was a matter between the two regulators. “It’s a matter between regulators, so they have to decide.”

The turf war concerns the nature of ULIPs which account for over 50 per cent of the total life insurance business in the country.

As on March 31, 2009, the total funds under the management of life insurance sector stood at over Rs 9 lakh crore of, accroding to the Life Insurance Council’s figure.

The life insurance companies against whom SEBI passed the order are SBI Life, ICICI Prudential, Tata AIG, Aegon Religare Life, Aviva Life, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla Sunlife, HDFC Standard Life, ING Vysya Life, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life, Max New York Life, Metlife India and Reliance Life.

IRDA’s order, however, will provide some relief to these life insurance companies.

The order issued by SEBI banned 14 insurance companies from issuing ""any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money from investors by way of new and/or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from SEBI.""

Withing 24 hours of the SEBI's director, insurance regulator IRDA fought back with its own order that said, ""all the 14 insurance companies which are mentioned in the order of SEBI are directed to note that notwithstanding the said Order of the SEBI, they shall continue to carry out insurance business as usual including offering, marketing and servicing ULIPs in accordance with the Insurance Act.”

Describing the action of SEBI as ""wholly misconceived and without jurisdiction"", IRDA said it would have brought the insurance industry to a ""stand still"" seriously jeopardising the interests of the policy holders and the interests of the insurers.

It would have resulted in ""complete drying up of the revenue flows to the insurance companies which could disrupt the payment of benefits on maturity, on death and on other admissible claims, putting the policyholder and the general public to irreparable financial loss.

""The financial position of the insurers will be seriously jeopardized thus destabilizing the market and upsetting financial stability"", IRDA added.

About 7.03 crore ULIP polices involving a total premium of Rs.90,645 crores were in force in 2008-09. As many as 16.7 lakhs policies were sold with a premium of Rs.44611 crores during April-February 2009-10.

ULIPs: lock-in period raised to 5 years,"After winning the turf war with the Securities and Exchange Board of India over control over unit-linked insurance products (ULIPs), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on Monday tightened the norms for these schemes by raising the lock-in period and raising the insurance cover on them.

The lock-in period for all ULIPs has been increased from three years to five years, including the top-up premiums, thereby making them long-term financial instruments, which basically provide risk protection, the IRDA said in the guidance note, released on Monday.

Besides insurance cover on such products, the premium has gone up to 10 times of the first-year premium compared to existing five times.

The fight between SEBI and IRDA was basically on the issue whether ULIPs are investment product or insurance schemes. ULIPs are those insurance products the value of which are linked to market price of the stocks in which a part of those money is invested.

IRDA tried to increase the insurance aspects of ULIPs. As was expected, commission and expenses have been reduced by evenly distributing it through out the lock-in period.

“Charges on ULIPs are mandated to be evenly distributed during the lock-in period to ensure that high front-ending of expenses is eliminated,” IRDA said, adding that all limited premium ULIPs, other than single premium products, shall have premium paying term of at least five years.

The regulator said that insurers will provide a mortality cover or a health cover to all ULIPs, other than pension and annuity products, thereby increasing the risk cover component on them.

Customers to benefit

Commenting on the guidelines, MetLife India Managing Director Rajesh Relan said, “prima facie the circular benefits the customer. This is yet another step taken by the IRDA to add more value to the policyholder and make the products more transparent. This will also improve persistency and provide long-term and sustainable income stream for distributors.”

However, Mr. Relan pointed out, “the full impact of these steps on industry players is yet to be ascertained, as we would seek further clarifications on certain clauses.”

As per the new guidelines, all ULIP pension or annuity products will offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent annually or as specified by the IRDA from time-to-time. This will protect the life time savings of pensioners from any adverse market fluctuations at the time of maturity, the circular said. All insurers are directed to conform to these features so that they can introduce products with due approval from the IRDA. From September 1, all ULIPs shall conform to this circular, the regulator said.

With a view to smoothening the cap on charges, the capping been rationalised to ensure that the difference in yield is capped from the fifth year onwards, the notification said. This will not only reduce the overall charges on these products, but also smoothen the charge structure for the policyholder, it added.

Besides, the IRDA has also amended regulations to further tighten the code of conduct of corporate agents to ensure that a customer does not deal with any unlicensed person. The regulations have also been amended to ensure that there is no scope for any kind of remuneration other than commission where sale has been effected, it said.

This measure will reduce the expenses of the insurer, thereby lowering premiums to be paid by the policyholder, it added.

Messi ready for crowning glory in Copa final,"Lionel Messi will bid to gild his legacy as the greatest footballer of his generation in New York on Sunday by ending Argentina's 23-year wait for a major title in a dream final against holders Chile in the Copa America Centenario.

For Messi's many millions of admirers, the five-time world footballer of the year has already achieved enough in his glittering career to be considered in the same bracket as Pele and Diego Maradona.

Yet the only hole in the Barcelona superstar's CV — a major tournament title with Argentina — is invariably, and somewhat unfairly, cited as a justification to delay his elevation to football's pantheon.

That could all change on Sunday before a sell-out crowd of 81,000 at East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium, the home of the NFL's New York Giants, when Argentina face the Chileans in a rematch of last year's Copa America final.

It is the third final in as many years for Messi and his teammates, who suffered agonising defeats in the 2014 World Cup final against Germany and to the Chileans on penalties in Santiago last year.

On each occasion, Messi has borne the brunt of the backlash from critics in Argentina who trot out a familiar laundry list of grievances. He has no passion. He doesn't sing the anthem. He doesn't ""feel"" the shirt.

Barely a ball had been kicked in this Copa America before Maradona, a regular sniper, accused him of lacking “personality” and “leadership.”

Don't come back

Maradona amped up the rhetoric this week shortly after Argentina booked their place in the final with a 4-0 demolition of the United States.

“We will certainly win on Sunday... and if we don't win, they shouldn't come back,” Maradona told an Argentinian television network.

Messi is not above being angered by the criticism.

“I get annoyed by the people who attack you without thinking,” he said in a recent interview.

“We got to two finals. We didn't win. What can you do? But we got to the final. It's not like we lost in the last 16.”

So far in the United States, Messi has shown no sign of being overburdened by the pressure to end Argentina's wait for a title.

After missing Argentina's opening group match — a 2-1 win over Sunday's opponents Chile — he scored an electrifying 19-minute hat-trick against Panama after coming on as a substitute before going on to equal Gabriel Batistuta's Argentina goals record in the 4-1 quarterfinal win over Venezuela.

Against the US on Tuesday, he scored a magnificent curling freekick to become his country's leading international goalscorer with 55, while setting up two more goals in a magical all-round display.

He even found the time to sign the shirt of an autograph-hunting fan who sprinted onto the pitch at the start of the second half.

Messi determined

His smiling, laidback demeanor however masks a fierce determination to lift the title, revealing that Argentina have become a more formidable unit since suffering the pain of multiple final defeats.

“It's been almost a year since the last Copa America, and I think that made us stronger as a group, and as a team,” Messi said.

“We grew a lot, in a lot of ways, and above all, even though we didn't win, it helped us.”

Yet while Argentinian fans — and many neutrals — will be willing Messi to victory, Chile have shown that they are more than capable of pulling off another ambush.

Since the opening loss to Argentina on June 6, the Chileans have improved with each game to compile their best run of results since Juan Antonio Pizzi replaced Jorge Sampaoli as manager in January.

They humiliated Mexico with a 7-0 thrashing in the quarterfinals and polished off Colombia 2-0 in the semifinals.

“They attack and defend with great intensity, and if you make a mistake they can punish you,” Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said after the semi-final loss.

A dynamic, combative midfield led by Bayern Munich star Arturo Vidal will ensure that Argentina's skilled attackers such as Messi, Nicolas Gaitan and Ever Banega have nothing like the freedom to operate they have enjoyed so far.

And Chile's razor sharp attack, which features tournament top scorer Eduardo Vargas (six goals) and Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez, should also pose more questions than Argentina's back four has been required to answer en route to the final.

NRA honours U.S. FCC chair Ajit Pai with rifle for repealing ‘net neutrality’,"The National Rifle Association (NRA) on Friday honoured the head of the Federal Communications Commission with a rifle after braving death threats and other opposition as he worked to undo the Obama administration’s 2015 net neutrality rules.

‘Courage under fire’

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was honoured at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Oxon Hills, Maryland, by the NRA with the “Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award,” an honour named for the late actor who was an NRA president.

The award is a Kentucky long rifle that will stay at the NRA’s museum in Fairfax, Virginia. The NRA was not allowed to bring the weapon on stage, said Carolyn Meadows, an NRA official.

It was not immediately clear why the NRA was not able to present the long gun to the FCC chairman. The FCC, CPAC and the NRA did not immediately respond to questions. A Reuters reporter at the event said there were no visible prohibitions against weapons at the event but metal detectors were present before President Donald Trump’s address earlier on Friday.

At the event, Mr. Pai defended his aggressive approach to undoing numerous telecommunications regulations put in place under former President Barack Obama.

“Some people urged me to go for sacrifice bunts and singles and try to nibble around the edges, make some minor changes,” Mr. Pai said. “But I don’t play small ball.”

Mr. Pai canceled his appearance in January at a large consumer electronics event in Las Vegas after receiving deaths threats, sources told Reuters.

The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for Internet service providers like AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., conferring power over what content consumers can access and allowing them to offer paid fast lanes for certain content.

Face-off with Facebook

On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal.

On Thursday, 22 state attorneys general sued to block the repeal. Fight for the Future, a group that backs net neutrality, said in a tweet “Hunh” the NRA gave Mr. Pai an award that will “allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to censor websites and information about guns.”

Several corporations have cut ties with the NRA after the group launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high-school.

Insurer Chubb Ltd. said on Friday that it would stop underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defence shootings.

Insurance company MetLife Inc. ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members, while several rental car companies announced they were ending discount programmes for NRA members.

Delta subjected to retribution in Georgia for crossing NRA,"As companies across America take a stand on guns after the Florida school massacre, Delta Air Lines withstood swift political retribution in its home state of Georgia for cutting ties with the National Rifle Association.

Ignoring warnings that the state’s business-friendly image could be tarnished, Republicans in the state legislature voted on Thursday to kill a tax break that would have saved Delta millions of dollars in sales tax on jet fuel. The proposal wasn’t controversial until Delta announced last weekend it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members.

“I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,” Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, said after his chamber gave final approval to a larger tax-cut bill that was stripped of the jet fuel tax exemption.

The Feb. 14 slayings of 17 students and educators in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle has prompted retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Dick’s Sporting Goods to tighten their gun sales policies. Meanwhile, Delta and other companies including MetLife and Hertz have ended business ties with the NRA.

                      Trump says some lawmakers too fearful of NRA to take action

Delta’s decision triggered a showdown with pro-gun lawmakers in Georgia, where the Atlanta-based airline is one of the largest employers with 33,000 employees statewide. Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the state Senate’s presiding officer, vowed on Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” tweeted Mr. Cagle, who is also running for governor.

GOP lawmakers amended a sweeping tax bill to eliminate a fuel-tax exemption worth at least an estimated $38 million to Delta and other airlines.

The Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all of the no votes. The House which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption before the Delta controversy erupted followed with a 135-24 vote.

Republican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an “unbecoming squabble” but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed.

The Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul.

Mr. Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory on Thursday.

“Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it’s all about the product,” said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. “And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of.”

GOP Sen. Michael Williams, another gubernatorial candidate, praised Republicans for holding out in the face of criticism from the news media and corporate America.

“We’ve stayed strong,” Mr. Williams said. “We’ve even stayed strong against our own governor.”

Among Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta’s decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break.

“The small steps that Delta and Dick’s Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,” Mr. Williams said. “We’re the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing.”

Critics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia’s ability to lure businesses including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters.

“It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,” said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. “But will it be the dominant factor? I don’t think so.”

USISPF | COVID-19 proves Indian economy's resilience: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,"COVID-19 and its aftermath has proven the Indian economy’s resilience, Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told U.S. investors in a meeting on June 24, adding that India’s fiscal situation is not only under control, but also expected to improve further.

Addressing a global investors’ meet hosted by the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), Ms. Sitharaman said that the government has shown a strong record of ‘reform implementation in the last six years’ and showcased the ‘strong relief and reforms undertaken during the pandemic times’.

“Macro-economic stability, infrastructure-led economic growth opportunities, financial sector reforms and positioning as a strong player in global supply chains are just some of the ways India continues to rise as a global economic powerhouse,” she said, stressing that there was a significant decline in new COVID-19 infections and a decline in the second wave.

At the meeting attended by global investors such as Mastercard, Metlife, Prudential, Dell, Softbank and Warburg Pincus, the broad messaged conveyed by the Finance Minister included the vision to make India ‘self-reliant and modern’ through the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat programme and driven by 5 ‘I’s – Intent, Inclusion, Investment, Infrastructure and Innovation.

The Finance Minister said India is committed to forge a long term relationship with U.S. investors and proposes to meet them twice a year. “The continuous reforms make India a great place to do business and the highest ever GST collections shows the bright spot — more formalisation of economy and tax compliance,” Ms. Sitharaman told investors as per an official statement.

Emphasising India’s ‘continued macro-economic stability and resilience in economic recovery in the recent months’, the Finance Minister said India’s wide-ranging reforms continue to position the country as an attractive destination for foreign investors. There are ‘new opportunities emerging for foreign investors with recent FDI reforms, privatisation policy and PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme’, she pointed out.

“Innovation and R&D got a great potential. New opportunities emerging for foreign investors with recent FDI reforms privatisation policy and PLI scheme,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement, summarising her message at the USISPF meeting.

According to the Ministry, First Solar CEO Mark Widmar applauded ‘the effort done already towards the investment opportunities in India, especially with the combination of industrial policy and the trade barriers that have enabled this initiative’. He was also encouraged to see the vaccination and economic progress, the statement said.

Ms. Sitharaman underlined that India had 15 new unicorns in 2021, reflecting its growing startup ecosystem ‘to be amongst the best in the world’. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told investors about the broad themes of the Union Budget and the far-reaching changes brought about.

"LIC raises Rs 5,627 crore from anchor investors led by domestic institutions","Insurance behemoth LIC on Tuesday said it has garnered a little over Rs 5,627 crore from anchor investors led primarily by domestic institutions ahead of its mega initial public offering (IPO).

Anchor Investors' (AIs) portion (5,92,96,853 equity shares) was subscribed at Rs 949 per equity share, the insurer said in an early morning filing to exchanges.

Out of the allocation of about 5.9 crore shares to AIs, 4.2 crore shares (71.12 per cent) were allocated to 15 domestic mutual funds through 99 schemes, the filing said.

Besides, investment was made by some domestic insurance companies and pension funds. Some of the prominent names in this category included ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, PNB Metlife Insurance, SBI Pension Fund and UTI Retirement Solutions Pension Fund Scheme.

Foreign participation included the Government of Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Government Pension Fund Global and BNP Investment LLP.

As per the prospectus, out of the 22.13 crore shares offered for sale, 5.93 crore shares were reserved for anchor investors.

The government by diluting 3.5 per cent stake in LIC would raise Rs 21,000 crore, the biggest ever IPO in the Indian market.  The previous such high fundraising was seen in the IPO of Paytm in 2021 at Rs 18,300 crore and Coal India in 2010 at Rs 15,200 crore.

The price band for LIC IPO is Rs 902-949 per equity share.

Policyholders will get a discount of Rs 60 per equity share, while retail investors and employees will get a discount of Rs 45 on each share.

Of the total shares on offer, over 9.88 crore shares are reserved for qualified institutional buyers and over 2.96 crore shares for non-institutional buyers. Up to 15,81,249 shares and 2,21,37,492 shares are reserved for employees and policyholders.

LIC would get listed and start trading on the stock exchanges on May 17.

LIC's embedded value, which is a measure of the consolidated shareholders' value in an insurance company, was pegged at about Rs 5.4 lakh crore as of September 30, 2021, by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors.

Based on investor feedback, the market value of government-owned LIC has been pegged at 1.1 times its embedded value or Rs 6 lakh crore.

LIC was formed by merging and nationalizing as many as 245 private life insurance companies on September 1, 1956, with an initial capital of Rs 5 crore.

Its product portfolio comprises 32 individual products (16 participating products and 16 non-participating products) and seven individual optional rider benefits. The insurer's group product portfolio comprises 11 group products.

As of December 2021, LIC had a market share of 61.6 per cent in terms of premiums or GWP, 61.4 per cent in terms of new business premium, 71.8 per cent in terms of the number of individual policies issued, and 88.8 per cent in terms of the number of group policies issued.

"Copa America: Argentina advances to quarterfinals, beats Chile 1-0 on Martinez’s goal","After nearly 90 minutes of total domination, Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina advanced to the Copa America quarterfinals after the ball ricocheted in front of the net during a frantic scramble that led to the breakthrough.

Lautaro Martínez scored off the last in a series of rebounds in the 88th minute, lifting the Albiceleste over Chile 1-0 on Tuesday night and into the quarterfinals with a game to spare.

LAUTARO MARTÍNEZ 🐂 pic.twitter.com/3BwopGlCeG

“The ball ended up right at me and I was able to convert it,"" said Martínez, who scored the second goal in last week's opening 2-0 win over Canada.

Messi started the leadup to the goal with a corner kick that was sent sent toward goal with a glancing header by defender Lisandro Martínez. The ball landed in front of goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, where Argentina's Giovani Lo Celso and Chile's Nicolás Fernández were wrestling. Lo Celso kicked the ball off Bravo and it rebounded to Chile's Igor Lichnovsky, who tried to poke it wide.

Lautaro Martínez, who entered in the 73rd, calmly one-timed that rebound into the roof of the net on Argentina's 21st shot. Players stood and waited for three minutes while the goal, Martínez's 26th for the national team, was confirmed in a video review.

“We deserved the win. It was not an easy match,"" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. ""We managed to win at the moment least expected.”

Argentina leads Group A with six points, followed by Canada with three, and Chile and Peru with one each. The Albiceleste finish the first round against Peru at Miami Gardens, Florida, on Saturday, when Canada meets Chile in Orlando, Florida.

Playing a day after his 37th birthday, Messi frequently flaunted his talent to spin around and slalom through defenders before an adoring sellout crowd of 81,106 at MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. Argentina dominated 22-3 in shots and 11-0 in corner kicks. Chile didn't take its first attempt until the 72nd minute.

Messi came the closest to scoring before Martínez with a 30-yard shot that glanced off the post to Bravo’s left in the 36th minute. Messi had received treatment on the thigh area of his right leg for nearly two minutes after getting kicked by Gabriel Suazo in the 24th.

Nicolás González’s shot from another Messi pass in the 62nd was parried off the crossbar by Bravo.

""I always have to save one or two every match. And I’m lucky to keep doing it,” Martínez said.

On the 46th anniversary of Argentina's first World Cup title, the teams returned to the stadium where Chile beat Argentina on penalty kicks in the 2016 Copa America final. That defeat prompted Messi to announce his international retirement only to reverse his decision seven weeks later.

At least 90% of the fans wore Argentina jerseys, most with Messi's name and No. 10.

There were some small brown patches behind one goal on a grass field installed at a stadium where the usual surface is artificial turf. The surface was narrow, with construction scheduled to allow a wider field for the World Cup.

Bravo, at 41 the oldest player in Copa America history, had eight saves in his 150th international appearance. He and Messi, former Barcelona teammates, spoke with each other while leading their teams onto the field for the national anthems.

“Losing this way leaves a bitter taste,” Bravo said. ""We played against a tremendous opponent.”

"13 minutes, $13 million: The logistics of pulling off a Super Bowl halftime show","The popular Super Bowl halftime show is only 13 minutes long, but the million-dollar-a-minute extravaganza takes thousands of people, months of planning and near military precision to pull off.

Organizers have the Herculean task of turning a football field into a concert venue and back in less than half an hour, and without damaging the playing surface.

Halftime at Sunday's 54th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs in Miami was headlined by Latina pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. It also featured surprise artists and other ensemble singers, said Dan Parise, a producer working with Roc Nation, the entertainment company producing the show with the National Football League.

PepsiCo is sponsoring the show for the eighth straight year. A source with direct knowledge of the show said it would cost about $13 million, a figure an NFL spokesperson declined to confirm.

“There are so many aspects of it, the dancers, the lighting elements, the special effects,” said Parise. “It's like a big jigsaw puzzle.”

The work starts almost a year in advance, said Mark Quenzel, the NFL's senior vice president for programming and production. Organizers scout the venue for logistical hurdles or unique structural elements they could use to their advantage.

In 2014, for example, producers had to keep Bruno Mars show relatively simple, because it was impossible to predict field conditions at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a rare outdoor cold weather Super Bowl.

This year, said Parise, a newly renovated overhang at Hard Rock Stadium allowed for deployment of more advanced audio equipment.

All in, the production takes 2,000 to 3,000 people to produce, said Quenzel, who is on his 10th halftime show.

Like past performances, this year's show will include an on-field audience of some 800 people, mostly kids from local schools who are cast in advance, and must rehearse with the artists.

Often, they are asked to play a larger role than that of cheering fans. During Justin Timberlake's 2018 rendition of Mirrors, the on-field crowd held up mirrors to reflect stadium lights.

The biggest feat of coordination is setting up the stage, which is wheeled in on 38 separate carts, each requiring 12 people to move. Another 18 carts, with 6-member teams, carry the audio equipment.

Like air traffic controllers, team leaders wearing headsets direct each team. A stage piece ending up in the wrong place, even by an inch or two, could be disastrous, Quenzel said.

The setup takes eight minutes, with the show itself lasting about 13. Removing the stage takes just over six minutes, Quenzel said, before the teams retake the field.

During the show, behind-the-scenes personnel wait in predetermined spots to carry away clothing during wardrobe changes that must be executed down to the second, Quenzel said. Part of the art of the show is what we don't show you, what you don't see, he said.

An example that stands out to Quenzel was in 2015, when pop star Katy Perry wanted to sing her hit, ‘Roar.’

She and the producers thought it would be fun if she entered riding a golden lion. The 6.1 metre mechanical beast was set on wheels concealed by legs that were pushed back and forth by performers to mimic footsteps.

For such a massive spectacle, there is precious little time to rehearse. Shakira and Lopez began separate rehearsals as early as December, Parise said, but had only a few days to practice together.

Rehearsals mostly took place at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, before moving to the Super Bowl stadium on Wednesday. We were working 12-to-15-hour days, Parise said.

Communication is another challenge. In addition to the hundreds of people hired by the NFL, each artist brings enormous teams of dancers and staff. To get everyone on the same page, producers hire veteran industry pros, including producer Ricky Kirshner and director Hamish Hamilton.

Sunday's show is said to feature plenty of special effects and dancing. But with all that goes into planning, it is important to remember the show is not the main event, Quenzel said.

“It's never lost on us that we're the side show,” he said.

Career in Actuarial Science,"As businesses and governments globally stepped up to adapt to a dynamically changing world, courtesy the pandemic, Actuarial Science began evolving to assume the new roles it now needs to play, as old functions became insufficient. More organisations have begun to rely on the skills of actuaries and analysts to model and plan for the future. Actuarial Science is slowly gaining popularity and recognition in India. A career in this field requires the use of Maths, statistical knowledge, risk assessment skills, and the evaluation of financial products such as insurance and investments. Risk-management skills provided by Actuarial Science can assist organisations in traversing and keeping up with the rapid changes in businesses.

According to IRDAI, the number of fully qualified insurance actuaries within India’s regulatory framework reached 458 last year compared to 439 in 2020. Many actuaries in India are qualified for practice outside of the Indian insurance market. They are now important in non-traditional roles like predicting the consequences of events such as climate change and pandemics such as
COVID-19, as well as in traditional roles such as devising and pricing appropriate products in a way that balances the interests of policyholders and insurance companies.

The process of becoming an actuary is linear, yet tough. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI ) oversees and regulates the education and training for domestic practice in India. The Society of Actuaries (SOA) provides education and research for actuaries practising in the large and growing offshore market in India. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) from the U.K. also provides education and research for actuaries in India. All these organisations have a rigorous education and exam process and maintain qualification through continuing professional development (CPD) and professionalism requirements.

Educational institutions in India have been closely watching the growing demand for actuaries, which is why many are now offering specialist actuarial degree programmes. Such recognised degree programmes are B.Sc. (Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance) and M.Sc. (Actuarial Science).

While historically, actuaries have often been associated with fields such as life, pensions and insurance, a growing number of professionals are now branching out into a newer variety of fields including but are not limited to health, banking and finance, technology, and climate change. An actuary’s role in each industry can be extremely different, ranging from product pricing, financial modelling, valuations, risk-management to carrying out peer reviews and designing social security schemes.

They can also serve as consultants for businesses, banks, financial consulting firms, actuarial consulting firms, the government sector, pension funds, investment advisories and can pursue academics as well.

The writer is Global Chief Actuary of MetLife and the immediate past President of the Society of Actuaries.

Protests continue against Garner verdict,"Thousands of diverse people united by anger took to the streets from New York City to San Francisco for a second straight night to protest a grand jury clearing a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man.

Grandparents marched with their grandchildren. Experienced activists stood alongside newcomers, and protesters of all colours chanted slogans. “We’re under siege and it has to stop,” Harlem resident Judy Edwards, 61, said at a rally on Thursday night in lower Manhattan’s Foley Square.

That was the message, too, in cities across America — Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis Oakland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., among them. Sign-carrying, chanting demonstrators marched down heavily-travelled streets and shut down highways and bridges. Politicians talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.

In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio, blasted by police union leaders who accused him of not supporting his officers, outlined previously announced plans to teach officers how to communicate better with people on the street.

President Barack Obama also weighed in, saying one of the chief issues at stake is “making sure that people have confidence that police and law enforcement and prosecutors are serving everybody equally.”
