If the application is approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ), M Pallonji Group will hold a majority stake of 51%, with additional investments from Federal Bank and several family offices. The group's promoters, Mehli Mistry and Pheroze Mistry, are cousins of the Shapoorji Mistry family. Mehli Mistry also serves as a trustee on Tata Trusts. The group has appointed Aditya Sharma, chief distribution officer at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, as CEO of its proposed general insurance venture. The group did not respond to ET's request for comment, while Sehgal declined to comment. Sehgal is investing in his personal capacity, besides drawing firm commitments from a couple of other family offices. Live Events The venture, currently in the initial regulatory stages, will undergo IRDAI's R1, R2, and R3 approval process. The R1 stage evaluates business projections, board approvals, and financial commitments, while R2 defines share capital requirements. R3 is the final approval. The company is expected to launch with an initial investment of ₹200 crore, backed by six investors, according to one of the sources. M Pallonji Group has prior experience in the insurance sector as a long-term investor in PNB MetLife, where it holds nearly a 20% stake. The group intends to exit this investment only during an IPO. As of September 30, 2024, MetLife increased its stake in PNB MetLife to 48.91%, while PNB holds 30%. The remaining shares are divided among other investors, including M Pallonji Group. This marks a rare instance of an Indian conglomerate taking a majority stake in a general insurance venture, in contrast to recent entrants that have primarily been foreign investors or private equity firms. M Pallonji Group's businesses span various sectors, including painting, dredging, stevedoring, logistics, shipping, finance, investments, life insurance, automobile dealerships, and the manufacturing of speciality coatings. The general insurance industry has been growing in double digits over the past several years. In FY24, it expanded by 15.5% year-on-year, with the gross direct premium income (GDPI) reaching ₹2.79 lakh crore. ICRA projects the sector to grow by 32% to ₹3.7 lakh crore by FY26. Over the last decade, corporate-backed entrants in the insurance sector have been limited, with most recent approvals granted to private equity-led ventures such as GoDigit (backed by Fairfax) and Acko General Insurance. Kshema General Insurance, launched in recent years, focuses on crop insurance. IRDAI chairman Debasish Panda has emphasised the need for greater corporate participation to improve insurance penetration, which currently stands at just 1% of GDP. In the February budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the foreign direct investment cap in the insurance sector from 74% to 100% to support long-term capital inflows. The industry currently comprises 26 life insurers, 27 general insurers, seven standalone health insurers, one domestic reinsurer and 13 foreign reinsurers. It has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. In FY24, total premiums reached ₹11.23 lakh crore, with assets under management at ₹67.57 lakh crore. Insurance penetration was at 3.7%, and density at $95 - both significantly below the global averages of 7% and $889, respectively. (",article tag,,2025.0,March,ET,,"['Premium', 'IRDAI']",2

Allowing 100% FDI in insurance may not only open the floodgates for offshore capital to enter India but also facilitate the entry of new foreign insurers, helping the country enhance insurance penetration to achieve the government’s goal of “Insurance for all by 2047”. There are 26 life and 32 general insurers in India, with most private sector players operating through a joint venture with a foreign partner. “When we talk about insurance for all by 2047, it really means every individual has at least a health policy, a life insurance policy, and a property policy that covers his home and his business. Most recently there is a proposal from the government to increase FDI insurance to 100%. Irdai is working on it,” Sood said. The regulator increased the FDI limit in insurance from 49% to 74% in 2021. The plan to raise it further aligns with its goal to widen the reach of insurance so every Indian citizen in the country is covered by some type of insurance by 2047. “Irdai is working on increasing the number of players in the country so that there is a deeper penetration and we can expect more and more coverage,” said Sood. The Irdai member added that the government could help enhance insurance coverage in the country by incentivizing offering tax benefits or subsidies. Also read | Is a GST rate cut for insurance good news? At the Mint BFSI Summit, Sood urged the insurance industry to rethink their distribution models to ensure a deeper market penetration, as well as to develop new products to address different needs and risks. Over the past two years, Irdai has reformed the product use and file process to encourage innovation in the insurance industry, he said, adding that a key innovation to enhance insurance penetration without increasing mis-selling was Irdai’s introduction of the “consumer information sheet”. “This document gives in very simple terms the coverage (and) the key points of the insurance policy that make the policyholder aware of what he is going to buy,” Sood said. “There are always a lot of grievances that the customer doesn’t know what he is buying since the details are in the fine print. This is specifically in that direction to address the issue and make clear to the customer what insurance he is buying.” Another key initiative is Bima Sugam—“an electronic insurance marketplace which aims at bringing all stakeholders in the value chain on one platform”. Sood said Bima Sugam was launched to align with the regulator’s ambition to increase efficiency, improve transparency, make more products available, enhance services, deepen penetration, and make claims settlement easier to get India closer to insurance for all by 2047. Also read | India’s self-employed: Bridging the insurance gap with tech-enabled solutions Sood also urged India’s insurance industry to enhance health insurance coverage in the country. The insurance regulator has made cashless settlements, pre-authorization within one hour of request, and discharge of post-authorization duties within three hours of claim mandatory. “There are penalties if the insurer fails to adhere to these norms. These measures are meant to make the claim process easy in health insurance. It is supported by a robust grievance handling mechanism,” said Sood. He added that while government schemes have covered a vast lower-income population and people with high income are able to afford insurance, the industry was missing out on the mass in the middle. “We have to work towards bringing a new approach, customised products, and developing new methodologies for distribution across new types of groups and do whatever it takes to address this missing middle-income group. Otherwise, a vast population remains without health insurance coverage,” said Sood. Also read | Insurers may get to sell related non-insurance value added products and services but not MFs Sood also highlighted the need for more domestic reinsurers amid emerging geopolitical risks and increasing natural disasters. “... there is decreasing capacity in the reinsurance market. We need to work on ways to increase domestic capacity, which can be brought about by the introduction of new players,” he said. Sood added that the industry needed to rethink ways to handle the “increasing number and severity of natural catastrophic events”. “We need to build capacity and new kinds of parametric products, which will make it easier for people to not only take insurance against these perils but also to be able to claim when such natural catastrophes strike,” Sood said. “We need to expand reinsurance capacity in this market so that we are able to handle more and more such events and be self-reliant.” Also read | A tech solution to crop insurance woes? Sood added that Irdai was working towards introducing a risk-based capital regime. “This will benefit both insurers and the market and assign capital to the appropriate risk. As we see more and more complex risks coming in, insurers will be able to better utilize and manage their capital.” He also urged insurers in India to work on better ways to deal with cyber risks. “The worst thing about cyber risk is it is not known where does it start and where does it attack,” said Sood. “We are carrying devices in our pockets and that is the way we are exposing ourselves to these risks. We have to develop methods to safeguard against these kind of risks.” With the evolution of quantum computing the face of such risk will again change “and it will be upon us in a much more complex way”, the Irdai member said. “We need to build measures to protect each individual, and if you are struck by it you see that you are protected through insurance.” Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Early onset of heart-related disease among Indians may lead to higher treatment costs, including medications and hospitalisation, which can be covered under comprehensive health insurance. However, claims related to the treatment of heart disease are often rejected due to certain factors. On World Heart Day 2024, let's understand the key reasons for rejecting health insurance claims related to heart ailments. Several factors, including non-disclosure of pre-existing disease (PED), waiting period, exclusion of specific treatments, etc., can lead to the rejection of health insurance claims, especially those related to heart disease treatments. Learn about the key reasons from health industry experts. Manish Dodeja, Head of Claims & Underwriting, Care Health Insurance, warned that it is always advisable for people to disclose their health conditions when taking health insurance. Failure to do so may lead to rejection of claims in the future. Conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood sugar levels, if not disclosed at the time of taking health insurance, may become a reason for health insurance claim rejection. “We have seen cases of non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions. For example, if somebody has been suffering from a heart condition or had a medical history related to the heart or any other condition that has not been disclosed to the insurance company. In that scenario, the insurance company may reject the claim, citing non-disclosure,” said Siddharth Singhal, Business Head of Health Insurance at Policybazaar.com. “Health Insurance policies have a waiting period for specific diseases, including those cardiovascular conditions. Claims made before the completion of this waiting period are rejected,” said Dodeja. Singhal explained the claim rejection cases due to waiting periods with an example: “If a person declares that he has a heart condition, then the insurance company would initially put a waiting period of three years. If the person claims for a heart disease treatment within three years, the insurance company obviously does not consider the claim favourable.”  He also advised people with a medical history to carefully consider the waiting period before taking insurance and consider the option of reducing the waiting period by remarkable riders available with several health insurance providers. A few medications and treatments fall out of the ambit of health insurance coverage. “Some health insurances may not cover certain specified procedures, medication. A thorough understanding of such exclusion is critical before purchasing a policy,” said Dodeja. Most heart disease treatments are covered by standard health insurance, but some expensive and rare treatments can be excluded from certain schemes.  Experts have underlined a few points to avoid claim rejection related to heart disease treatment: Complete disclosure of health conditions, knowledge of policy coverage, proper understanding of the waiting period, opting for specialised health insurance, preferring network hospitals for treatment, etc. “If your Health Insurance claim is rejected, the first step is to carefully review the rejection letter to understand the reason behind the denial, which could be due to missing documentation or policy-related issues. Once you have the clarity, you can appeal to your insurer, providing the additional documentation or correcting errors in your submission, in case that is the reason for rejection,” said Manish Dodeja. “If policyholders are unhappy even after contacting insurers,they can approach theInsurance Ombudsman. If insurers are still unsatisfied with the claim,they can also take the matter to court,” noted Singhal.

This rise reflects increased awareness and financial inclusion among women. The analysis also highlights a growing preference for higher coverage plans, with women opting for policies exceeding  ₹2 crore, according to PolicyBazaar data. PolicyBazaar's data also indicated an uptick in the growing trend in smaller cities. Andhra Pradesh's Guntur ranked among the top five cities where women purchased the most term insurance policies.

Concurrently, the Annual Report of IRDAI for FY23-24 underscored substantial challenges in the insurance sector. Notably, over two lakh complaints were lodged via the centralised grievance portal, with a significant portion targeting life insurers for unfair business practices, excluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India. ""Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of a few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. Prompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary to increase insurance penetration. Acknowledging misselling and misrepresentation and compensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, fund management, banking and insurance firms,"" the document noted. Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates The Union government tabled the Economic Survey 2023-24 in Parliament. The Economic Survey document, prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and formulated under the supervision of the chief economic adviser, gives insights into the state of the economy and various indicators of 2023-24 (April-March) and some outlook for the current year.  With this upcoming budget presentation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's upcoming budget speech will be her seventh. “We commend the IRDAI's initiatives to prioritize the wellbeing of policyholders, from implementing cashless systems to emphasizing Ombudsman schemes, ensuring policyholders' interests are safeguarded. However, with increasing climate change and economic development-related risks, there is a pressing need to protect against unforeseen disruptions. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritizing risk management and protection. We recommend that the government consider the following measures: •Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to INR 75,000. •Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs). •Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches. •Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class.

Here’s how an unlimited sum-insured health plan can help you,2 min read.06 Jul 2024,"Comprehensive health insurance provides a much-needed shield from critical illnesses and unprecedented health emergencies. In contrast to a higher sum insured amount, which provides a cushion to expensive treatment, a health plan with an unlimited sum insured amount eliminates the concern of exhausting the claim limit during treatment. Currently, there are fewer options for health insurance plans with unlimited sum insured features. However, they can act as saviour in terms of critical illnesses and other ailments requiring advanced treatment. Here’s all you need to know about unlimited sum insured plans. The sum insured by a health insurance plan is the maximum amount a person can avail for healthcare treatment. As the name suggests, an unlimited sum insured plan provides unlimited coverage to customers for healthcare treatment. Generally, health insurance plans come with a sum insured amount of  ₹5 lakh,  ₹25 lakh,  ₹1 crore, and more. However, there is no capping on the amount under unlimited sum insured plans. This feature empowers customers to avail of healthcare treatment without worrying about cost. An unlimited sum insured plan is helpful for people with pre-existing diseases or those at risk of age-related disease, according to Siddharth Singhal - Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. “People are often confused when choosing sum insured because you never know when a medical emergency might hit you. Covid, for instance, nobody could’ve imagined it, but it wreaked havoc on people’s lifetime savings. In such cases, it’s best to go with an unlimited sum insured,” said Singhal. By opting for this plan, a person can claim their health insurance unlimited times in a year with no upper limit for the claim amount. However, the situation varies according to the plan. Recently, ICICI Lombard launched a health insurance product, ‘Elevate’, which provides unlimited sum insured to policyholders. People can opt for this feature as an add-on service or as a critical feature of their policy. Bajaj Allianze’s Health Infinity Plan provides unlimited coverage. Customers can also avail themselves of wellness discounts, family discounts, and other benefits. The Unlimited Acko Platinum Plan also comes with an unlimited sum insured feature, allowing people to claim unlimited coverage for their health care treatment. Other key features of the plan include a zero-waiting period for pre-existing disease (PED) and 100% hospitalisation bill payment. Health insurance plans with an unlimited sum insured come with higher premiums than plans with a fixed sum insured amount. “The unlimited health insurance plan costs between  ₹15,000 and  ₹20,000. If a person chooses a plan with a  ₹10 lakh sum insured and above and adds a rider for unlimited coverage, it’ll cost them about  ₹7,000— ₹8,000 + 10% for the rider,” explained Singhal.

Here’s when you can get a full refund from the airline,2 min read.14 Mar 2024,"Let’s assume you are on a vacation with a full-planned itinerary. You are set to return home on a certain date, but due to some unavoidable reasons, you now need to return earlier. LiveMint talked to experts to understand under what circumstances a person who has taken travel insurance would be allowed to get a full refund of their return tickets. According to Manas Kapoor, business head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com, travellers can get a full refund in the case of a medical emergency. This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies. Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the Supreme Court of India, added, “The definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.” Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, “but majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.” Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund. “In such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,” said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors. Kapoor explained that these documents may include proofs like admission to a hospital and a doctor’s advice on returning. According to Bajaj, there are some other cases when an airline may have to fully refund a traveller. “In cases where the airline cancels a flight due to bad weather, mechanical issues, or staffing problems or if there is a significant rescheduling in the flight timings, the passengers are entitled to get a full refund regardless of the reason for cancellation,” Bajaj said. However, in these cases, according to the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), an airline is bound to provide a traveller with an alternative at no additional cost. If one does not accept it, they are not bound to get any compensation. “One is not entitled to any compensation or refund in case you don’t accept alternative travel arrangements or if the cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, like any force majeure events like civil war, natural disasters, security risks, government regulations etc,” said Sneha Bhogle Kale, partner at Accord Juris LLP. The compensation or refund is covered under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), Section-3, Series-M, Part-IV of the DGCA rules.

Reproductive Health Services: expanded insurance coverage that includes reproductive health services such as contraception, fertility treatments, and reproductive surgeries can empower women to make informed decisions about their health and family planning, improving female mortality and India’s sex ratio which stands at about 929:1000(female:male ratio) Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in Indian women, and survival rates post 5 years of incidence are just 66%, amongst the lowest in the world. Tailored insurance plans can offer coverage for breast cancer screening, diagnostic tests, treatments, and post-treatment care to ensure early detection and effective management of the disease. Gender-specific Illnesses Coverage: Insurance policies include coverage for gender-specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometriosis, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. Women-specific Health Check-ups: Insurance policies can include coverage for regular health check-ups, preventive screenings, and wellness programs tailored to women's health needs. Critical Illness Coverage: Comprehensive coverage for critical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes can ensure access to advanced medical treatments and ongoing care for women facing serious health challenges. The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2021-22 highlights that the Female labour force participation (FLFPR) rate in India for the working age group (15 years & above) has increased considerably to 32.8%, still well below the global average of 47 percent for several years. Boosting women's entrepreneurship: Insurance schemes can support women entrepreneurs by providing packaged coverage for businesses, business interruption coverage plans, and fostering entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. Income Protection: Income protection plans specifically designed for women can provide financial support in case of career breaks due to childbirth, caregiving responsibilities, or health issues. Childcare Support: Insurance plans may offer childcare benefits to help working mothers cover the costs of childcare services, enabling them to balance work and family responsibilities effectively. By incorporating these various coverage into insurance policies, insurers would effectively address the specific needs and priorities of women, promoting gender equality, financial inclusion, and overall well-being.

Hence, it is important to be financially prepared for such fatal diseases with health coverage. Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance. Also Read: Focus on essential features when choosing health insurance, says Vivek Chaturvedi By 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022. On World Cancer Day, know about the insurance options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses. Also Read: The Role of Cancer Insurance in Cancer Prevention and Early Detection A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment. Also Read: 9.3 lakh lives lost to cancer in India, urging the need for comprehensive health insurance There is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer. “A cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,” explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal. One of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc. Also Read: Here’s why doctors should consider professional indemnity insurance “A critical illness cover acts as a top–up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,” noted Singhal. A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it “offers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions”. However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed. “A cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,” Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint. Sum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to  ₹30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of  ₹50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal. Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. “Hence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,” said Singhal.

Details here,1 min read.02 Feb 2024,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has recently issued directions to all insurance companies telling them to cover AYUSH treatment just as other treatments. AYUSH refers to the treatment given under alternative therapies of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. The latest move stems from the growing prevalence of these treatments, because of which the regulator felt the need to consider these treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of health insurance. The IRDAI circular says, “the insurance companies will have a board approved policy for providing AYUSH coverage which will include their approach towards placing AYUSH treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of health insurance so as to provide an option for the policyholders to choose treatment of their choice.” “The policy will also contain the quality parameters as well as procedure for enrolling AYUSH hospitals/ day care centres as network providers for the purpose of providing cashless facilities,” the circular adds. The circular further says that the insurers will have adequate controls as well as standard operating procedures for a number of activities which include the following: 1. Enrolling hospitals into their network. 2 Placing necessary clauses in their health services agreements with Ayush hospitals/ day care centres. 3. Standard treatment protocols, and 4. Dealing with the possible frauds and abuse of the system, if any For this purpose, the Ministry of Ayush on Oct 4, 2023 constituted a ‘Core Group of Experts for Insurance Sector’. The insurance companies are told to actively engage with this group in order to develop required modalities for providing Ayush coverage. The directions issued on Jan 31 will come into effect from April 1, 2024. Meanwhile, in another news IRDAI chief flagged the concern of high premium and highlighted the need for individual risk profiling. IRDAI Chief Debasish Panda said data analytics should ensure that premiums take into account the individual risk and not the average risk of the group. “There is a need to build an ecosystem where premiums are no longer one-size-fits all but are customised to individual risk profiling,” he said.

Early onset of heart-related disease among Indians may lead to higher treatment costs, including medications and hospitalisation, which can be covered under comprehensive health insurance. However, claims related to the treatment of heart disease are often rejected due to certain factors. On World Heart Day 2024, let's understand the key reasons for rejecting health insurance claims related to heart ailments. Several factors, including non-disclosure of pre-existing disease (PED), waiting period, exclusion of specific treatments, etc., can lead to the rejection of health insurance claims, especially those related to heart disease treatments. Learn about the key reasons from health industry experts. Manish Dodeja, Head of Claims & Underwriting, Care Health Insurance, warned that it is always advisable for people to disclose their health conditions when taking health insurance. Failure to do so may lead to rejection of claims in the future. Conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood sugar levels, if not disclosed at the time of taking health insurance, may become a reason for health insurance claim rejection. “We have seen cases of non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions. For example, if somebody has been suffering from a heart condition or had a medical history related to the heart or any other condition that has not been disclosed to the insurance company. In that scenario, the insurance company may reject the claim, citing non-disclosure,” said Siddharth Singhal, Business Head of Health Insurance at Policybazaar.com. “Health Insurance policies have a waiting period for specific diseases, including those cardiovascular conditions. Claims made before the completion of this waiting period are rejected,” said Dodeja. Singhal explained the claim rejection cases due to waiting periods with an example: “If a person declares that he has a heart condition, then the insurance company would initially put a waiting period of three years. If the person claims for a heart disease treatment within three years, the insurance company obviously does not consider the claim favourable.”  He also advised people with a medical history to carefully consider the waiting period before taking insurance and consider the option of reducing the waiting period by remarkable riders available with several health insurance providers. A few medications and treatments fall out of the ambit of health insurance coverage. “Some health insurances may not cover certain specified procedures, medication. A thorough understanding of such exclusion is critical before purchasing a policy,” said Dodeja. Most heart disease treatments are covered by standard health insurance, but some expensive and rare treatments can be excluded from certain schemes.  Experts have underlined a few points to avoid claim rejection related to heart disease treatment: Complete disclosure of health conditions, knowledge of policy coverage, proper understanding of the waiting period, opting for specialised health insurance, preferring network hospitals for treatment, etc. “If your Health Insurance claim is rejected, the first step is to carefully review the rejection letter to understand the reason behind the denial, which could be due to missing documentation or policy-related issues. Once you have the clarity, you can appeal to your insurer, providing the additional documentation or correcting errors in your submission, in case that is the reason for rejection,” said Manish Dodeja. “If policyholders are unhappy even after contacting insurers,they can approach theInsurance Ombudsman. If insurers are still unsatisfied with the claim,they can also take the matter to court,” noted Singhal.

PolicyBazaar's data also indicated an uptick in the growing trend in smaller cities. Andhra Pradesh's Guntur ranked among the top five cities where women purchased the most term insurance policies.

Hold on! Major relief may be coming for policyholders. Details here,2 min read.08 Sep 2024,"The 54th Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, scheduled for September 9, 2024, in New Delhi, may discuss the possibility of removing the 18 percent GST on term life insurance premiums, according to multiple media reports. Various stakeholders in the insurance sector have long advocated for this removal. Industry experts believe enacting this decision, i.e., eliminating this tax, would significantly alleviate the financial burden on insurance customers. The 18 percent GST on life and health insurance premiums has long been contentious, with many stakeholders pushing for its removal. “Multiple stakeholders, including sitting ministers, have requested to exempt GST on term and health insurance. Likely, the GST Council may favourably consider this industry demand, especially if the revenue loss due to the grant of such exemption is not major. However, to allow the full effect of exemption from GST to be passed on to the public at large, the insurance companies would also need to be allowed full input tax credit without requiring a reversal of credit due to exemption from GST on term insurance,” said Sandeep Pareek, Partner, Indirect Tax, BDO India. Currently, the 18 percent GST on term life insurance premiums adds to the cost of insurance. “Term life insurance is essentially an insurance that acts as a safeguard to guarantee that families are protected in the case of the policy holder’s death. Whenever the government applies such high taxation rates on such premiums, it dissuades individuals from taking risks by opting for this necessary shield. Further lowering or complete elimination of GST may cause the enhanced purchase of term life insurance, which is still in its infancy in the country,” said Siddharth Maurya, Founder and Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited. Sandeep Pareek highlights that exempting GST from term insurance products could significantly promote these plans by making them more affordable for the public. Siddharth Maurya adds, “Reducing or removing GST on term insurance premiums could encourage more people to secure their families' futures without additional financial burden. This would also expand the insurance coverage base, fostering industry growth.” Maurya also believes such a decision could transform India’s insurance sector. “It would demonstrate the regulator's commitment to making life insurance more accessible and effective as a risk management tool. We anticipate the GST Council will adopt a forward-thinking approach that benefits millions of Indians.” Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to eliminate the GST on health and life insurance premiums. In a letter dated August 24, O'Brien stated, “The 18% GST on health and life insurance premiums places an undue strain on many, affecting their access to crucial financial protection in times of illness, accidents, or untimely death. Our shared responsibility is to ensure that this vital safety net remains affordable for all segments of society.” The GST Council, which includes the Union Finance Minister and representatives from all States and Union Territories, was created to oversee decisions on various GST matters, such as tax rates, exemptions, and administrative procedures. It has been instrumental in shaping India's GST framework. Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

With this upcoming budget presentation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's upcoming budget speech will be her seventh. “We commend the IRDAI's initiatives to prioritize the wellbeing of policyholders, from implementing cashless systems to emphasizing Ombudsman schemes, ensuring policyholders' interests are safeguarded. However, with increasing climate change and economic development-related risks, there is a pressing need to protect against unforeseen disruptions. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritizing risk management and protection. We recommend that the government consider the following measures: •Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to INR 75,000. •Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs). •Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches. •Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class.

Here’s how an unlimited sum-insured health plan can help you,2 min read.06 Jul 2024,"Comprehensive health insurance provides a much-needed shield from critical illnesses and unprecedented health emergencies. In contrast to a higher sum insured amount, which provides a cushion to expensive treatment, a health plan with an unlimited sum insured amount eliminates the concern of exhausting the claim limit during treatment. Currently, there are fewer options for health insurance plans with unlimited sum insured features. However, they can act as saviour in terms of critical illnesses and other ailments requiring advanced treatment. Here’s all you need to know about unlimited sum insured plans. The sum insured by a health insurance plan is the maximum amount a person can avail for healthcare treatment. As the name suggests, an unlimited sum insured plan provides unlimited coverage to customers for healthcare treatment. Generally, health insurance plans come with a sum insured amount of  ₹5 lakh,  ₹25 lakh,  ₹1 crore, and more. However, there is no capping on the amount under unlimited sum insured plans. This feature empowers customers to avail of healthcare treatment without worrying about cost. An unlimited sum insured plan is helpful for people with pre-existing diseases or those at risk of age-related disease, according to Siddharth Singhal - Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. “People are often confused when choosing sum insured because you never know when a medical emergency might hit you. Covid, for instance, nobody could’ve imagined it, but it wreaked havoc on people’s lifetime savings. In such cases, it’s best to go with an unlimited sum insured,” said Singhal. By opting for this plan, a person can claim their health insurance unlimited times in a year with no upper limit for the claim amount. However, the situation varies according to the plan. Recently, ICICI Lombard launched a health insurance product, ‘Elevate’, which provides unlimited sum insured to policyholders. People can opt for this feature as an add-on service or as a critical feature of their policy. Bajaj Allianze’s Health Infinity Plan provides unlimited coverage. Customers can also avail themselves of wellness discounts, family discounts, and other benefits. The Unlimited Acko Platinum Plan also comes with an unlimited sum insured feature, allowing people to claim unlimited coverage for their health care treatment. Other key features of the plan include a zero-waiting period for pre-existing disease (PED) and 100% hospitalisation bill payment. Health insurance plans with an unlimited sum insured come with higher premiums than plans with a fixed sum insured amount. “The unlimited health insurance plan costs between  ₹15,000 and  ₹20,000. If a person chooses a plan with a  ₹10 lakh sum insured and above and adds a rider for unlimited coverage, it’ll cost them about  ₹7,000— ₹8,000 + 10% for the rider,” explained Singhal.

Know from experts,3 min read.28 Jun 2024,"National Insurance Awareness Day 2024: The low insurance penetration in India is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of millions of Indians to financial burden and crisis in case of untoward incidents like terminal illness, accident, etc. National Insurance Awareness Day, observed every year on June 28, is an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of taking insurance. From early adulthood to retirement, the right insurance helps a person secure the future of himself and his family. According to Casparus Kromhout MD & CEO of Shriram Life Insurance, insurance is crucial not only for personal coverage but also to safeguarding a person's valuable assets like home, car, and business from damage, theft, or liabilities. “Many insurance products offer tax benefits and can even be used as investment tools. This means that while you're enjoying the protection insurance provides, you can also grow your wealth and make your money work for you,” said Casparus Kromhout. Insurance awareness is crucial for financial security because of the unfortunate COVID-19, there has been a substantial improvement in awareness. Despite understanding the importance of insurance, people tend to postpone purchasing a policy, often due to misconceptions about the costs or a belief that they can delay it without consequence. This procrastination is a significant reason why insurance penetration rates remain low in India, even though literacy rates are rising. It's essential to not only be aware of insurance but also to recognize its immediate necessity to truly secure one's financial future. Contrary to popular belief, life insurance doesn't have to be expensive. Premiums can be adjusted to fit different budgets, and options like term insurance offer substantial coverage at affordable rates. You can buy policies for yourself, your spouse, or even your children. Joint policies and child plans provide comprehensive coverage for your loved ones too. “India, being one of the fastest-growing insurance markets, still has a relatively low insurance penetration rate of 4% of its GDP, leaving a sizable gap. This gap is largely due to a lack of awareness and accessibility of insurance and its critical role in financial stability during unforeseen incidents. On this National Insurance Awareness Day, the industry must spread awareness and work towards closing this gap,"" said Dhirendra Mahyavanshi, Co-founder and CEO of Turtlemint. “Being aware about insurance options and regularly reviewing policies are key steps in achieving comprehensive financial security.Adequate insurance coverage protects against unforeseen events, reducing the financial burden caused by accidents, illnesses, natural disasters, or other unexpected circumstances. By keeping updated for various insurance options and encouraging regular policy reviews, individuals can ensure they are adequately protected, thereby safeguarding their financial stability and peace of mind,” said Shashi Kant Dahuja Chief Underwriting Officer, Shriram General Insurance. “On this National Insurance Awareness Day, we at ManipalCigna Health Insurance emphasize the vital role health insurance plays in securing a healthier future for all. Health insurance is a living benefit product; so just as mutual funds are essential for financial growth, health insurance is crucial to access easy and lifetime quality healthcare without the burden of unforeseen medical expenses. So, everyone should consider the benefits of health insurance and make it a priority,” said Prasun Sikdar, MD & CEO, ManipalCigna Health Insurance. “In a country like India, where many families lack sufficient financial protection, it is crucial to understand not just the importance of life insurance but also the need for adequate coverage. While it's promising that nearly 70% of families have some form of life insurance, the key question remains: is the coverage adequate? Underinsurance can leave loved ones vulnerable, and the entire insurance ecosystem, led by the regulator, is undertaking numerous measures to ensure that everyone understands the need for the right cover. This Insurance Awareness Day is an opportune time to highlight this critical issue. The general rule of thumb is to secure life cover that is 10 times your annual income,” said Anil PM, Head of Legal, Compliance, and FPU at Bajaj Allianz Life.

Notably, this figure climbs to 97% for claims initiated through online channels, demonstrating the efficiency and potential transparency facilitated by digital platforms in the claims process. Furthermore, the integration of online platforms results in a significant decrease in rejection rates, dropping from an average of 6% to just 2.5%. While approval rates are encouraging, the report identifies an area for improvement in claim payout amounts, which currently stand at 87%. Ensuring a 100% payout percentage remains an aspiration, particularly by enhancing awareness about add-ons like consumables cover. Customer satisfaction emerges as a pivotal metric in evaluating the health insurance landscape. The report highlights that 86% of customers reported satisfaction with their claim experiences. This positive feedback reflects the industry's ongoing efforts to meet and exceed customer expectations, bolstering overall trust in insurance providers. Despite high approval rates, a significant proportion of claim rejections (6%) stem from non-disclosure of pre-existing or uncovered diseases. This issue underscores the importance of transparent communication between insurers and policyholders at the time of purchase to prevent such pitfalls. The involvement of intermediaries in the claims process significantly influences the outcomes. When customers resubmit rejected claims themselves, only 6% succeed in having their decisions reversed. However, this rate improves dramatically to 32% with the assistance of offline agents and jumps to 67% when utilising online intermediaries. The report delves into the preferences and challenges associated with cashless and reimbursement claims. Notably, 70% of reimbursement claimants seek financial aid to cover upfront payments, indicating a reliance on out-of-pocket resources due to various factors such as the unavailability of cashless facilities or preferred healthcare providers not being in the insurer's network. Despite an 86% satisfaction rate, there is room for improvement given the high stakes involved. Key strategies include enhancing cashless claim availability beyond metropolitan areas, improving efficiency in claims processing, and bolstering on-ground presence for psychological comfort, the report highlights.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/medical-insurance-claims-irdai-cashless-approvals-guidelines-faster-processing-hospital-discharge-delays-11717082598158.html,Health insurance: New rule for faster cashless approvals might get off to a slow start,4 min read.01 Jun 2024,"The insurance regulator’s recent rule changes to make life easier for policyholders will likely require a sectoral overhaul before patients are able to get discharged from hospitals faster. While insurance industry experts pin the blame on hospitals for slow processing at the time of a patient’s discharge, a lot of the delays in cashless aprovals of medical claims also stem from procedural hiccups. A new digital information-sharing platform still in the discussion stage and an increased role for technology platforms might, however, help the regulator achieve its ambition of ensuring that patients cleared for discharge aren’t held back because of protracted processing. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India recently made it mandatory for medical insurance firms to authorise cashless hospitalisation within 1 hour of a request being made, and within 3 hours for a final approval at discharge. The new rules are to be implemented by 31 July. This, however, is unlikely to ease the plight of policyholders, say industry experts. For one, according to several experts Mint spoke with, hospitals spend much time in processing medical bills and sending them to insurers. “If there is a delay of 12 hours after the treating doctor gives a go-ahead for discharge, hospitals will have taken 8 hours and insurance companies the rest,” said Dr. Prashant Mishra, a Mumbai-based cardiac surgeon. The other significant challenge arises when insurance companies seek additional information from hospitals. “The tariffs for many surgeries are fixed in packages. But disputes arise on what is covered or not in the package. (Insurance firms) disallow certain billing and negotiate rates,” said Dr. G. Anil Krishna, chairman and managing director at Medicover Hospitals. “So far as cashless pre-approval is concerned, (insurers) tend to ask for a lot of documents to figure out if an insurance is valid or not. For example, ascertaining if a patient is really a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic as he or she claimed,” he added. “Medical care in India is subsidised but is still unaffordable for many. Finding an ideal solution is difficult.” Dr. S. Prakash, MD and CEO-designate at Galaxy Health and Allied Insurance, offered a counter. “Delays arise from both insurer-related issues and hospital-related issues, such as hospitals not adhering to all insurance provider requirements.” There might, however, be a solution or two in the near future. The Union health ministry is holding discussions to establish a National Health Claim Exchange (NHCX), an online platform comprising stakeholders including hospitals, insurance companies, and third-party administrators (or TPAs, which are intermediaries between insurers and policyholders). The exchange would enable sharing of claims information digitally, allowing for faster processing. NHCX will create a standard interface to be followed by all participants, but would require patients to give their consent for sharing their health history for it to be effective. They can do this by creating an Ayushman Bharat Health Account and uploading their health history. ABHA is a digital health card issued by the National Health Authority under India’s flagship health mission. “It is a great idea that will improve the turnaround time and reduce the cost from all ends if all stakeholders adopt,” said Narendra Bharindwal, vice president, Insurance Brokers Association of India. “The challenge is hospitals are unregulated. We have to see how many of them join the platform.” Apollo Hospitals, Sterling Hospitals and Manipal Hospital did not immediately reply to emails seeking comments. Also read | Irdai’s policy rollback: How it affects insurance surrenders The National Health Claim Exchange, apart, insure-tech companies could help reduce manual processing at hospitals and insurance companies, effectively bringing down the time taken to decide on a claim. Insure-tech companies can play a crucial role in shortening the claims journey via automation, said Sumit Ramani, actuary and co-founder at ProtectMeWell.com. For example, while extracting information from a medical document and converting it into medical codes requires experts, the process is increasingly getting automated using artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, he added. “Once the information is converted into medical codes, it would need to be compared to the benefits covered under the policy to identify payable claims,” said Ramani. “Equally running predefined rules to curb fraud, wastage, and abuse becomes easier on standardised data, thus increasing confidence, turnaround time, and accuracy of claims processed.” The insurance industry, as well as the medical sector in general, is awaiting the establishment of a health regulator that can standardise treatment costs and processes across hospitals. “Standardising tariffs across the industry can help in reducing turnaround time well below 3 hours even in complex billing where to-and-fro happens,” said Bhaskar Nerurkar, head-health administration team, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. “We take about 30 minutes on average in cashless pre-approvals and about 47 minutes after receiving bills from the hospital,” he added. “In cases where the process takes more than 3 hours, the company will take a favourable decision for the customer.” Also read | New health insurance regulator may arrive faster than we thought There are two types of hospitalisation—planned and emergency. Most planned hospitalisations do not require much time for insurance approvals. “Typically, 80% of the cases with planned hospitalisation do not face delays after insurance companies receive the billing,” said Bharindwal of the Insurance Brokers Association of India. “But there could be a delay in the rest of the cases where additional information from hospitals are required.” Irdai also recently allowed customers the option to increase the sum insured or opt for a no-claim discount on the premium at the time of renewal. Presently, only the former is offered. A customer having multiple health insurance policies can decide the order in which they want to make a claim, said Mahavir Chopra, co-founder of insurance platform Beshak.org. “Insurance companies will have to coordinate with each other, not policyholders.” Also read | Insurance reforms in first 100 days agenda of BJP government if voted back Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

By removing the age ceiling of 65 years for purchasing health insurance, IRDAI has expanded access to health insurance products for individuals of various age groups. Previously, seniors above 65 years could still buy health coverage, but options were limited in the market. ""With these policy changes, senior citizens will have a smooth access to quality healthcare. Further, while shortlisting the right coverage that suits their needs, consumers should also evaluate factors like a cashless network of healthcare providers of an insurer, room rent limit, benefits, sub-limits and other policy terms and conditions. These would enable individuals to get coverage that aligns perfectly with their requirements and budget, said spokesperson Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance. ""The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) has ushered in a transformative change by eliminating the 65-year age limit for health insurance purchases. This groundbreaking decision, effective from April 1, will ensure health coverage is now accessible to all, transcending age barriers. ’’ Pooja Yadav, chief product officer, Zuno General Insurance. According to Ajay Shah, health insurance premiums for senior citizens, especially those with pre-existing conditions, might be higher depending on the sum insured, age, and health condition. “The impact of IRDAI's decision on health insurance for senior citizens is expected to be profound. Insurance companies will likely respond by designing specialized products tailored to the needs of this demographic, including coverage for pre-existing conditions,” said Rakesh Jain, CEO, Reliance General Insurance Managing the higher risks linked with insuring older age groups, like more medical expenses and pre-existing conditions, is a major concern. Rakesh Jain noted that adjusting underwriting practices to properly evaluate and price these risks while staying competitive is a significant challenge. Moreover, Jain highlighted that providing affordable and comprehensive coverage for senior citizens in the face of increasing healthcare costs needs innovative product design and risk management strategies. Previously, individuals were limited to buying new insurance policies until age 65. However, effective April 1, 2024, the insurance regulator removed the age cap on purchasing health insurance policies. ""Insurers shall ensure that they offer health insurance products to cater to all age groups. Insurers may design products specifically for senior citizens, students, children, maternity, and any other group as specified by the Competent Authority,"" IRDAI had said in a notification issued earlier. Industry experts believe this initiative encourages competition among insurers, potentially resulting in better consumer offerings and services. Ultimately, it sets the stage for enhanced financial security and long-term health planning for senior citizens.

In certain cases, even an insurance holder ends up paying out of his pocket (OOP) on some medical expenses. To specifically help such cases, the recently-propped up healthcare fintechs provide services such as no-cost EMI loans, embedded insurance, etc. Unlike health insurance which provides coverage of a certain amount in return for regular premiums (with conditions linked to waiting periods, diseases covered, etc), healthcare fintechs provide interest-free credit regardless of the type of treatment. “We cover what insurance does not. A customer can avail of over 300 healthcare treatments and services across our network, including preventive and elective treatments as well,” said Jitin Bhasin, founder of SaveIn healthcare fintech. “Ironically, people can buy a no-cost EMI washing machine, but they can't buy a no-cost EMI for knee replacement operation. That is the problem that we wanted to solve by simplifying healthcare expenses,” said Chris George, founder of QubeHealth, a healthcare fintech. The B2B startup provides two key products to the employees or members of its corporate clients. First is Qube Pay, a UPI-based payment feature and second is Qube Cash, which provides credit up to  ₹10 lakh on zero interest for 12 months. Easily available credit can be used for treatments that are not covered in health insurance plans like cosmetic surgery, hair transplant, etc. When basic health insurance plans fail to cover certain treatments like the ones that don’t require hospitalisation, it is easier to unlock a customised credit line with the help of healthcare fintech services, according to Jatin Bhasin, SaveIn founder. Underlining the vast coverage of healthcare treatment services by SaveIn, Bhasin said, “Several credit-card holders with SaveIn’s no-cost EMI plans can pay for their healthcare within 10 seconds and avail a loan for 3,6,9, and even 12 months on zero-cost EMIs.” Customers can visit SaveIN partners near them and can avail of healthcare products and treatments at zero or low-cost EMIs. Embedded insurance refers to insurance coverage which is integrated or included as a part of another product or service. QubeHealth is working to build a system where users can avail the benefit of customised embedded insurance while making a medical transaction, noted Chris George. “When expecting parents will pay for maternity expenses with Qube Pay, they will get an embedded insurance product that essentially pays for all of paediatric care after the child is born,” said George while explaining the service which will be included in the Qube Pay app in future. QubeHealth is in the process of utilising artificial intelligence for building predictive spending and pattern analysis. The AI-driven feature of the QubePay application would provide suggestions related to hospitalisation and healthcare based on the kind of health insurance plan that has been taken by its customer. The company has rolled out this AI-led feature on a trial basis and will expand this service to a larger user base in future.  The application will also provide suggestions based on medical history, which will be stored digitally in the form of e-reports.

Before investing in an insurance policy, it is paramount to understand the fundamental terminology. Before you invest in an insurance policy, it's essential to understand the basic terminology for better coverage comprehension. Understanding terms like premiums, deductibles, coverage limits, and policy riders is essential for better usage of insurance policies. In an interview with Mint,  Sharad Bajaj, COO, ofInsuranceDekho discussed the key components of insurance Understanding both what is covered (inclusions) and what is not (exclusions), as well as any limitations or restrictions, helps avoid surprises when filing a claim. The financial side of insurance involves premiums and deductibles. Premiums, determined by assessing risk and coverage, determine the insurance cost. Deductibles are the amount the policyholder must pay out of pocket before insurance starts. It directly impacts out-of-pocket expenses and monthly premiums. Each insurance policy has coverage limits, which represent the maximum amount the insurer will pay for a covered loss. It's essential to comprehend these limits to prevent being underinsured and experiencing financial strain during a substantial loss. Policy riders and endorsements provide flexibility, which is crucial in insurance. These optional additions enable policyholders to customize their coverage to better suit their needs, whether by adding protection for specific risks or enhancing existing coverage. Submitting an insurance claim can feel overwhelming, especially when facing difficult circumstances. Familiarising oneself with the claims process, including documentation needs and resolution timelines, can simplify the process and ensure a smoother experience during challenging times. Insurance isn't a one-time thing; it's ongoing. Understanding how to renew or cancel policies is crucial. Being aware of renewal deadlines, premium adjustments, and any terms that impact policy continuation or termination is essential for continuous coverage. Understanding insurance rules and regulations may appear daunting, but unraveling its complexities is not impossible. It's always recommended to carefully read and understand all terms and conditions. Note: This story is for informational purposes only.

Here’s when you can get a full refund from the airline,2 min read.14 Mar 2024,"Let’s assume you are on a vacation with a full-planned itinerary. You are set to return home on a certain date, but due to some unavoidable reasons, you now need to return earlier. LiveMint talked to experts to understand under what circumstances a person who has taken travel insurance would be allowed to get a full refund of their return tickets. According to Manas Kapoor, business head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com, travellers can get a full refund in the case of a medical emergency. This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies. Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the Supreme Court of India, added, “The definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.” Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, “but majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.” Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund. “In such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,” said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors. Kapoor explained that these documents may include proofs like admission to a hospital and a doctor’s advice on returning. According to Bajaj, there are some other cases when an airline may have to fully refund a traveller. “In cases where the airline cancels a flight due to bad weather, mechanical issues, or staffing problems or if there is a significant rescheduling in the flight timings, the passengers are entitled to get a full refund regardless of the reason for cancellation,” Bajaj said. However, in these cases, according to the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), an airline is bound to provide a traveller with an alternative at no additional cost. If one does not accept it, they are not bound to get any compensation. “One is not entitled to any compensation or refund in case you don’t accept alternative travel arrangements or if the cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, like any force majeure events like civil war, natural disasters, security risks, government regulations etc,” said Sneha Bhogle Kale, partner at Accord Juris LLP. The compensation or refund is covered under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), Section-3, Series-M, Part-IV of the DGCA rules.

Reproductive Health Services: expanded insurance coverage that includes reproductive health services such as contraception, fertility treatments, and reproductive surgeries can empower women to make informed decisions about their health and family planning, improving female mortality and India’s sex ratio which stands at about 929:1000(female:male ratio) Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in Indian women, and survival rates post 5 years of incidence are just 66%, amongst the lowest in the world. Tailored insurance plans can offer coverage for breast cancer screening, diagnostic tests, treatments, and post-treatment care to ensure early detection and effective management of the disease. Gender-specific Illnesses Coverage: Insurance policies include coverage for gender-specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometriosis, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. Women-specific Health Check-ups: Insurance policies can include coverage for regular health check-ups, preventive screenings, and wellness programs tailored to women's health needs. Critical Illness Coverage: Comprehensive coverage for critical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes can ensure access to advanced medical treatments and ongoing care for women facing serious health challenges. The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2021-22 highlights that the Female labour force participation (FLFPR) rate in India for the working age group (15 years & above) has increased considerably to 32.8%, still well below the global average of 47 percent for several years. Boosting women's entrepreneurship: Insurance schemes can support women entrepreneurs by providing packaged coverage for businesses, business interruption coverage plans, and fostering entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. Income Protection: Income protection plans specifically designed for women can provide financial support in case of career breaks due to childbirth, caregiving responsibilities, or health issues. Childcare Support: Insurance plans may offer childcare benefits to help working mothers cover the costs of childcare services, enabling them to balance work and family responsibilities effectively.

Hence, it is important to be financially prepared for such fatal diseases with health coverage. Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance. Also Read: Focus on essential features when choosing health insurance, says Vivek Chaturvedi By 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022. On World Cancer Day, know about the insurance options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses. Also Read: The Role of Cancer Insurance in Cancer Prevention and Early Detection A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment. Also Read: 9.3 lakh lives lost to cancer in India, urging the need for comprehensive health insurance There is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer. “A cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,” explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal. One of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc. Also Read: Here’s why doctors should consider professional indemnity insurance “A critical illness cover acts as a top–up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,” noted Singhal. A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it “offers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions”. However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed. “A cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,” Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint. Sum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to  ₹30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of  ₹50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal. Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. “Hence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,” said Singhal. In addition to this, it is equally important to compare and analyse various cancer coverage plans online for an informed decision. Moreover, it is a must to have a better understanding of the exclusions in the policy. Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Highlighting the need for the individual risk profiling, IRDAI Chief Debasish Panda said data analytics should ensure that premiums take into account the individual risk and not the average risk of the group. ""There is need to build an ecosystem where premiums are no longer one-size-fits all but are customised to individual risk profiling,"" he said. The IRDAI Chief also said that the regulator is nudging insurers to adopt the account aggregator framework, a consent-based architecture for seamless exchange of information. ""So far 28 insurers have onboarded as financial information providers and another 32 as financial information users while 27 have been onboarded as both,"" he said. In order to maintain an open dialogue with the industry, the regulator has been conducting quarterly meetings, called Bima Manthan, with executives to take their feedback on different issues. ""Bima manthan is an excellent feedback mechanism to understand how the regulatory architecture is getting translated on the ground. For example, the feedback led to the introduction of a simple customer information sheet in health insurance,"" he said. IRDAI has mandated insurers to create the revised CIS from January 1 onwards. CIS will include material details of health insurance policies such as sum assured, exclusions, sub-limits, etc in a simplified language. “Same would be introduced in other lines of business,” he added. To promote further innovation, the regulator conducts an insuretech open house where it interacts with tech companies on a monthly basis to understand and implement innovative solutions that give a fillip to the insurance sector. Panda also said that they are considering a provision that would require laws to be reviewed every three years to keep pace with changing times in the insurance industry. “We are considering a sunset clause of three years on regulations for policy dynamism,"" said Panda. “From 100 odd policy regulations, we are hoping to have 15-odd regulations to streamline industry growth. This is what will provide ease of doing business and the operational freedom and flexibility"" he said. Panda also added that they have appointed an expert committee that will look into simplifying the language of the insurance so that it becomes more comprehensible for the citizens who buy insurance policies. He said that a report on this matter will come out soon. “The insurance industry is categorized for using jargon. We are looking into simplifying the policy document,"" said Panda on the topic ‘Insurance’s innovation agenda’. The IRDAI chief also talked about the Bima trinity which is being conceptualised. He said that the trinity includes Bima Vistar,a simple benefit based product based on pragmatic triggers, Bima Vahak, which is a localised women centric insurance scheme by the community and Bema Sugam, an electronic platform which would universalise and democratise insurance products. “I believe this will a game chnager in the insurance landscape,” said Panda. “This protocal would be connected to the India Stack to utilise the unique national digital infrastructure enabling seamless delivery of insurance“ Panda also highlighted the growth of affordable insurance schemes by the government like the like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Joti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY).

According to a report by Live Law, Justice Anand Venkatesh emphasized the work done by AYUSH doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and added that traditional medicines were also recommended to the infected patient under AYUSH which provided relief to several patients. Therefore the Madras HC asserted that it would be irrelevant to deprive policyholders of getting reimbursements for the amount spent on AYUSH treatments under the medical insurance. The court also said that an individual decides to either opt for an AYUSH treatment or an Allopathic treatment, therefore, the expenses incurred in either of the treatments had to be placed on equal scales. Medical inflation surges at an alarming rate The judge said giving preference to allopathy would be discriminatory and directed IRDAI to draft a policy keeping AYUSH treatments in mind. The Madras HC also asked IRDAI to encourage traditional treatments like AYUSH. It said patients who undergo such treatments should be entitled to receive the insurance amount for the expenses incurred by him. Dental treatment is costly. Here’s how you can finance it The Madras HC was hearing two pleas filed by an advocate and a clerk claiming full reimbursements of the amount by their respective insurance companies.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/explained-the-importance-of-travel-insurance-in-a-shrinking-world-11699347727849.html,Explained: The importance of travel insurance in a shrinking world,3 min read.07 Nov 2023,"As the world shrinks, people travel to far-off places for work and pleasure. Travel insurance now assumes greater importance than ever before. Travel insurance is very important especially while you are travelling abroad. Let us discuss what it covers and when one should buy it. Though the word “Travel Insurance” suggests that expenses related to travel only are covered but travel insurance covers more than that. It also covers your hospitalisation while you are abroad which is important because the health insurance purchased by you in India generally covers your hospitalisation in India only. Some of the countries make the purchase of travel insurance a precondition before the issuance of a visa. Looking at the cost of medical treatments in some developed countries, it is a prerequisite for you to buy adequate travel insurance to safeguard yourself against a big hole in your pocket. Generally, travel insurance covers your loss of checked-in baggage, the cost of treatment, and hospitalisation abroad. Though most of the insurers do not cover your pre-existing disease a few of the insurers cover the treatment in case of life-threatening diseases. This also covers loss suffered due to delay or cancellation of your flights. It also covers any emergency arising out of delay or cancellation of flights. Since international travel insurance is supposed to cover majorly your hospitalisation, you should take into account the cost of hospitalisation in the country you are travelling to. Moreover, as it covers the loss of your checked-in luggage, you should take into account the value of your valuable belongings like your camera, laptop, etc. which you are carrying with you. You also need to factor in the cost of ticketing as well as hotel stay in case of delay or cancellation of flights. In case you are a frequent flier, you can buy a Multi-Trip travel insurance that covers you for all future trips taken within a specific period, with the same level of cover. For instance, if you buy an annual multi-trip travel insurance plan, you will be covered for any trips you go on during that year. However, in case your travel is one thing, you should buy travel insurance before undertaking that journey. The premium of the travel insurance will depend on the period for which you are buying the travel insurance as well as the country you are travelling. Since hospitalisation is the major item that is covered under travel insurance, the premium will depend on the country you are travelling to. Some of the companies offer you cheaper insurance with sub-limits. Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here For domestic travel, you may decide not to buy the insurance in case you are adequately covered under your regular health insurance. You may still decide to cover the two other elements of coverage like loss of baggage and loss due to delay or cancellation of flights but generally nobody buys domestic travel insurance. One should buy travel insurance before one undertakes a trip whether it is a foreign trip or domestic trip. One can buy it online as well if one is comfortable doing it. The travel insurance to buy will depend on the country and period for which you are travelling and thus you will have to compare the premium and features of various insurance companies which provides travel insurance. Since most of the insurance companies provide you with instant quotes based on the data fed, you can check and compare a few insurance company websites to zero on specific products. Keep in mind that selecting the right insurance policy has to be done carefully, since just like regular insurance, travel insurance comes in many options, and there is no one right plan.

The capital infusion would be based on the financial performance of the general insurers  in nine months, the report also said. According to the PTI report citing sources, the finance ministry last year asked three insurers to chase bottomlines rather than topline and underwrite only good proposals. Last year, the government had provided  ₹5,000 crore capital to National Insurance Company Ltd, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd and United India Insurance Company. Kolkata-based National Insurance Company was provided  ₹3,700 crore, followed by Delhi-based Oriental Insurance Company ( ₹1,200 crore) and Chennai-based United India Insurance ( ₹100 crore). During fiscal year 2019-20, the government infused  ₹2,500 crore in these three companies. In the following year, it increased substantially to  ₹9,950 crore and  ₹5,000 crore in fiscal year 2021-22. “The financial review would give some idea about the impact of restructuring initiated on the profitability numbers and the solvency margin,” said the report. The solvency margin, the extra capital the companies must hold over and above the claim amounts they are likely to incur, acts as a financial backup in extreme situations. The three general insurers  have been asked to improve their solvency ratio and meet the regulatory requirement of 150%. The solvency ratio is a measure of capital adequacy. A higher ratio reflects better financial health and the ability of the company to pay claims and meet future contingencies and business growth plans. The solvency ratio of the three public sector general insurance companies is below the regulatory requirement of 150%.

The meeting with the General Insurance Council and leaders and CEOs of private sector general insurance companies discussed the concerns of the insurance industry, which is facing penalties imposed by tax authorities for Goods and Services Tax (GST) input tax credit violations. Notably, the finance ministry has so far refrained from intervening in this matter. The meeting also discussed initiatives to enhance public awareness through continuous engagement with individual states, aimed at elevating insurance penetration and coverage. Discussions also revolved around the imperative need to streamline distribution channels, particularly in expanding the agency channel within the general insurance industry to further augment insurance penetration. The meeting underscored the need for a more robust and coordinated approach between states and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to launch a special drive to ensure compliance with the Motor Vehicles Act and enhance collaboration with the Ministry of Health to elevate the prevalence of cashless facilities and standardize treatment costs, thereby fostering growth within the health insurance sector. Insurance companies were asked to actively promote the adoption of property/parametric covers that serve as essential tools to mitigate financial losses caused by natural catastrophes, and extend insurance coverage to the MSME sector. Addressing the issue of fraud prevention, participants in the meeting recognized the necessity of linking insurance frauds to the CIBIL score as a means of enhancing security and accountability within the industry. It was also agreed that regular meetings will be convened with representatives from both the private and public sectors of the insurance industry.

Discussions on this matter have taken place in Life Insurance Council meetings over the past few months, two sources told The Economic Times. While a formal letter from the council is pending, the sources state that talks are in an advanced stage, aiming to establish self-regulation in this regard, they added. The development comes as the industry adjusts its marketing practices in response to IRDAI's decision to replace product-wise caps with company-wise ones, a move prompted by insurers facing GST evasion charges, as per the report. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) is the regulatory authority of the insurance sector. In March, the regulator introduced the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, shifting from the traditional product-specific commission structure to an overall cap on expenses within insurance companies. The directive mandated managing operations within a 30 percent overall expense limit. Despite being allowed to pay 5 percent on commissions until March, insurers often opted for higher overriding commissions of 30-35 percent or more to enhance market share, the report said. It was thus found that in certain insurer-bank or insurer-NBFC partnerships, where a housing loan of  ₹1 crore aligns with a policy sum assured of the same amount, the premium has surged to 35 percent, up from 5 percent until March, it added. Credit life insurance, a type designed to aid loan repayment in case of the insured person's demise before full repayment, has seen a significant increase in premiums. While the policy is optional, if chosen, its cost is added to the loan principal. The alteration in commission structures was prompted by scrutiny from the GST authorities, who issued show-cause notices to numerous insurance companies. The investigation revealed that insurers were paying overriding commissions to agents through vendors, falsely categorized as marketing, advertising, and manpower supply costs, evading tax without actual services rendered. Many insurance companies are now under examination for providing overriding commissions to banks and intermediaries, in addition to regular commissions. This practice raises concerns about potential exploitation and an increase in management expenses within the insurance industry. The investigation brought to light that insurance companies were covering banks' employee costs through intermediaries, not transparently represented in their financial records, leading to non-disclosure and potential violations of tax laws.

He rebuilt it with a host of fire protections, but it costs 10 times as much to insure. He couldn’t get a policy that covers fires, so he turned to California’s insurer of last resort for fire insurance. The cost for that policy is more than $9,600 a year. He pays around $1,200 a year for a policy to cover other risks. “The insurance is more than my mortgage,” Dubie said. “The cost is astronomical and the coverage is not as good as it used to be.” He said he and his wife will struggle to keep their home. Hundreds of thousands of people nationally are signing up with state insurers of last resort as home insurers pull back from disaster-prone areas. More than 30 states have some form of last-resort plan for people who can’t get coverage elsewhere. Plans can be statewide or restricted to coastal regions. Coverage varies between states, ranging from all-perils policies to those that cover wind, hail or fire only. The plans were designed to be temporary safety nets. As the private market shrinks, however, the plans are becoming insurers of first, not last, resort in some high-risk areas. In Florida, the Citizens Property Insurance last-resort plan is the biggest home insurer in the state with 1.4 million policies. Florida, California and Louisiana have each seen policyholder numbers for their last-resort plans more than double within the past five years, according to plan representatives, and there’s no sign of a letup. The California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan is piling on policies, adding what a spokesman called a historic 25,000 policyholders in August—more than three times the 7,000 monthly cap on new home policies Farmers Insurance imposed recently in the state. The exodus to last-resort plans is leaving many people saddled with what can be high-cost, bare-bones coverage. “These plans were really only supposed to be a ‘break glass in emergency’ type of a product,” said Douglas Heller, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. “Now that the insurance industry is walking away from communities, we’d better have a much more robust and healthy public backstop.” The surging numbers of last-resort policyholders, who by their nature tend to be higher risk, raise the possibility that a plan will need to be bailed out when the next big hurricane or wildfire strikes. Depending on the state, that would impose an added cost on insurers, policyholders or taxpayers. “This is such an obvious slow motion train wreck,” said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, an industry body. Insurers are concerned they will have to pick up the tab if the California Fair Plan can’t meet its claims, and may not be allowed to recover that cost through rate increases, Frazier said. That’s helping drive the pullback from the state, he added. Michael Soller, California’s deputy insurance commissioner, said, “The growing Fair Plan is a problem not just for people in the Fair Plan, but for everybody in the state.” Even in states where the last-resort plan offers fairly comprehensive home-insurance coverage, such as Citizens in Florida, the risk of an additional charge levied on insurers, policyholders or taxpayers can be a significant downside. Floridians with Citizens policies could get hit with a surcharge of up to 45% of their premiums if the plan is wiped out by a big storm. “Policyholders are much better off being with a private insurance company than Citizens, not only for better coverage but to escape the potential ‘tax’ that can happen,” said Lisa Miller, a former Florida insurance regulator. Another downside to the plans, consumer advocates say: Most are actively trying to shrink, so have little incentive to handle claims efficiently. “They live in opposite land, they don’t want people to buy their policy,” said Amy Bach, executive director at the consumer-advocacy group United Policyholders. State lawmakers and regulators are taking steps to try to reverse the influx into last-resort plans, by moving policyholders back into private home-insurance policies. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last month said the steadily increasing number of last-resort policies, particularly in areas with the highest wildfire risks, “has threatened the ongoing stability of the plan.” Moves by other states to shift policyholders from last-resort plans have met with mixed results, in part because lawmakers are reluctant to allow politically unpopular rate hikes. “Any time you get politicians involved in setting rates, there is always a tendency to suppress them from what is actuarially indicated,” said David Sampson, chief executive of industry body the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, which covers wind and hail losses for certain coastal properties, charges homeowners 20% less than the rate needed to cover the underlying risks, an official report this year found. But the plan’s board, appointed indirectly by the state governor, voted to keep rates unchanged, the fourth time in the past five years there has been no increase. In the spring, the state offered 31,959 of its 200,000 policyholders the chance to switch to a private insurer. Just 46 people accepted the offer. Another planned round of offers has been axed because no insurance company wants to take part, according to the plan. A spokesman said the industry’s cold shoulder “reflects the current state of the private market, which is generally restricting its [under]writing.” Florida also charges insufficiently high rates to cover the risks in its last-resort plan, according to a spokesman for industry body the Insurance Information Institute. Rates on Citizen’s most popular home-insurance policy were increased last month by 11.5%, compared with an average 42% hike in the private market, he said. Rate restrictions have also affected California’s Fair Plan. It requested a 48.8% rate hike in 2021, but in July regulators approved an increase of just 15.7%, state filings show. Still, its rates are plenty high enough for policyholders such as Dubie. The 57-year-old college biology teacher said insurance costs on his rebuilt home soak up much of his income. “I’m working for the insurance company now,” he added.

The launch of the platform, which has already missed two deadlines, has now been rescheduled for June 2024. The regulator claims that the proposed portal will be a ‘game-changer’ and a ‘UPI moment’ for the insurance sector. Bima Sugam aims to simplify the process of purchasing insurance for consumers.  This online platform is where customers can choose a suitable scheme from multiple options given by various companies.  All insurance requirements, including those for life, health, and general insurance (including motor and travel) will be met by Bima Sugam. ""This platform will help in the settlement of claims, whether it’s health coverage or death claims, in a paperless manner on the basis of policy numbers. In short, identifying the right policy, buying it, and settling the claims and renewals will be streamlined in the online process that Bima Sugam will introduce. Insurance companies (both general and life insurers) will be major shareholders in the platform, which will offer facilities to customers via an ‘e-insurance account’ (E-IA),” said Tejinder Singh senior consultant of Alpha Capital. It will facilitate insurance companies to access the validated and authentic data from various touch points on a real-time basis. The platform will interface for the intermediaries and agents to sell policies and provide services to policyholders, among others, and reduce paperwork. Further, the paperwork involved in buying a policy will also come down. Settlement of claims and renewal of policies will also become faster as paperwork is reduced drastically, making it easier for the customers. The scheme shall benefit consumers more than the agents, since this will affect the commissions drastically and reduce paperwork involved in processing the claims. “IRDAI’s robust platform will benefit insurers, hospitals, and policyholders alike. This exchange will serve as a centralized hub for health insurance-related activities; ensuring efficient policy management, quick & hassle-free processing of claims, automatic fund transfer for policyholders & hospitals, and reduced cost per claim to the insurer,” said Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance. It will provide end-to-end solutions for customers’ insurance needs i.e., purchase, service, and settlement in a seamless manner. “First, you can buy policies, pay premiums, and settle all claims on a single platform. You don’t have to visit the websites of different insurers separately. Secondly, you can choose a repository to maintain all your insurance policies. If you have all the links stored in one place, claim settlement will become easier for nominees and beneficiaries,” said Tejinder Singh With this proactive measure, IRDAI looks forward to driving positive change in the industry. The initiative will not only meet changing market demands but also position India as a thought leader for insurance innovation.

HDFC Life, SBI Life closely follow",1 min read.16 Sep 2023,"Securing the financial future of our loved ones is a responsibility that resonates with us all. As the insurance landscape flourishes, it's crucial to shine a spotlight on a key determinant of an insurer's trustworthiness – the claim settlement ratio. While many factors influence the choice of a life insurance policy, the claim settlement ratio often remains overlooked despite its profound significance. Let’s have a look at the most recent claim settlement ratio of the life insurance company for Q1FY24.  The chart clearly highlights that ICICI Prudential Life Insurance stands at the top of the chart by settling 97.9% of the claims received and providing the best customer service. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has always kept the claim settlement ratio as one of the most important aspects considering that customers trust them with their hard-earned money. ICICI Pru is followed by SBI Life with a 95.8% claim settlement ratio, HDFC Life  with a 96.7% claim settlement ratio An interesting fact, Under their ‘Claim for sure initiative’ death claims will be settled in 1 day, provided some terms and conditions are met, the company claims. With the ‘Claim For Sure’ service initiative, the company aims to reduce the financial distress caused to families due to this loss. A claim settlement ratio highlights the proportion of insurance claims that an insurer successfully addresses in comparison to the total claims lodged by policyholders or their beneficiaries. This ratio is computed by dividing the total count of settled insurance claims by the overall number of claims received by the insurance company, then multiplying the result by 100. For instance, if an insurer receives 10,000 new claims within a specific year and resolves 9,800 of those claims while keeping the rest unresolved due to various reasons, the claim settlement ratio for that year would be calculated as (9,800/10,000 × 100), which equals 98%. As a general guideline, a claim settlement ratio exceeding 80% is deemed favorable. Leading insurance firms in the nation consistently maintain a claim settlement ratio surpassing 95%. Considering the claim settlement ratio when purchasing life insurance is pivotal. It reflects the insurer's reliability, ethical practices, and efficiency in processing claims. A high ratio not only assures timely financial support for beneficiaries but also offers peace of mind and effective financial planning.

In the survey, which covered over 1,000 people in the age group of 28 to 55, ACKO found out that following the COVID-19 pandemic, awareness about health insurance has increased. However, it also added that the health coverage of most Indians is insufficient compared to the medical expenses. Among other details, the insurance company said that though 60 percent say they understand the policy terms and conditions, but their awareness is primarily limited to cash treatment, accident cover, and 100 percent bill payment. Also, 60 percent of respondents do not think of buying health insurance with over  ₹10 lakh coverage, while 65 percent believe that  ₹10 lakh health coverage is sufficient for them. Apart from this, 64 percent said they have not increased the coverage and kept it the same as the previous year. On this parameter, 46 percent of policyholders said that their health policy covers the entire ‘hospitalization along with consumables’, while 59 percent of potential buyers are looking for policies with 100 percent bill payment. Also, 27 percent are unaware of the waiting period and said that 'there are no waiting periods in the health insurance policies', and 31 percent feel that they are covered from day 1. The survey even found out that among the existing and potential policyholders, the family floater policies are the top favorite, with 71 percent and 72 percent, respectively. Citing the reasons, policyholders said that the plans offer them the option to include their parents, spouses, and children in the same policy. The deterrents working against the health insurance companies include a slow claim settlement process, partial bill payment, and inadequate network hospitals. The survey found that 43 percent find the claim settlement process cumbersome. Also, 47 percent of policyholders and 56 percent of potential buyers find the lack of a 100 percent bill payment facility put them off.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/jio-financial-to-enter-insurance-plans-global-tieups-11693247734718.html,"Jio Financial to enter insurance, plans global tie-ups",2 min read.29 Aug 2023,"Jio Financial Services Ltd (JFSL) is set to launch a slew of insurance products, possibly in partnership with global companies, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on Monday. “JFSL will enter the insurance segment to offer simple, yet smart, life-, general- and health-insurance products through a seamless digital interface, potentially partnering with global players,” Ambani said at RIL’s virtual annual general meeting. Although Jio Financial has been seen as a disruptor in the financial-services space given Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s runaway success in telecom, many believe it wouldn’t be easy to replicate that success in insurance and other financial-sector products. That is because the financial-services space is more tightly regulated and established entities such as banks, non-banks and insurance firms have built their businesses over years. Still, Jio’s entry could lead to greater penetration of insurance in India. Insurance penetration, or the ratio of total insurance premiums to gross domestic product (GDP), in the country rose from 2.7% around the turn of the millennium to 4.2% in 2020, and remained the same in 2021, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23. The company, Ambani said, will use predictive data analytics to co-create contextual products with partners. Last October, RIL announced the demerger of its financial-services business. As part of the demerger, each RIL shareholder received shares in Jio Financial on a 1:1 basis in July. So far, Jio has tied up with BlackRock, the US manager of $11 trillion in assets for an asset management venture in India. “JFSL has been conceptualized to fill a critical gap in the financial-services needs of a large section of the Indian economy, mainly in the informal and underserved sectors in rural, semi-urban, and urban areas,” said Ambani. He said for tens of thousands of small businesses, merchants, and self-employed entrepreneurs, the ease of doing business must mean ease in borrowing, investments, and payment solutions. Jio Financial, he said, plans to democratize financial services for 1.42 billion Indians, giving them access to simple, affordable, innovative, and intuitive products and services. “In payments, JFSL will consolidate its payments infrastructure with a ubiquitous offering for both consumers and merchants, further driving digital payment adoption for India,” he said. Ambani said Jio Financial products will not just compete with current industry benchmarks but also explore features such as blockchain-based platforms and central bank digital currency (CBDC). “They will adhere to the highest standards of security, regulatory norms, and ensure protection of customer transaction data at all times,” he said. RIL has capitalized Jio Financial with a net worth of  ₹1.2 trillion to create one of the world’s highest capitalized financial-service platforms at inception, he said, adding that it has a strong board, led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath. “A highly motivated leadership team is being built with a combination of financial industry experts and young leaders who are eager to take on big challenges,” Ambani said.

The need for comprehensive health coverage for senior citizens has become more apparent, however, the penetration continues to be a challenge. According to census reports, India has 1,380 lakh elderly citizens and is further expected to increase by around 560 lakh by 2031. However, only 25 per cent companies - out of Plum’s over 3,500 customer base- have parental covers. This leaves a wide gap in coverage for senior citizens, who include parents and parent in-laws. The insurtech surveyed around 300 customers and observed that 29 per cent of employees feel that the organisation-sponsored health insurance is inadequate in terms of the sum insured. It also found that 13 per cent of employees availed super top-up as the organisation-sponsored insurance does not cover parents and family. There has been a steady demand from employees around the need for coverage for the elderly, and one way to approach this is through super top-ups (in addition to increased parental coverage). ""In the face of the silent crisis gripping our senior citizens, Plum is committed to confronting this challenge head-on.  The 98 per cent of uninsured senior citizens is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities they face,'' said said Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and CEO of Plum. ‘’It will always be our endeavour to innovate and come up with solutions that simplify access and availability of health insurance towards the underinsured. Our goal is to contribute to the larger vision of 'Insurance for All by 2047', ensuring that every individual, regardless of their age or circumstances, can access the protection they deserve,'' added Poddar. Amid rising costs for basic healthcare access in India, medical coverage for parents and senior citizens has become increasingly critical. For citizens in this age group, the coverage often goes beyond basic protection, encompassing valuable supplementary benefits such as cashless hospitalisation, critical illness insurance, as well as targeted coverage for conditions such as cancer and stroke.

The detailed 17-page guidelines posted on the tax authority’s website explained the changes introduced in the Income Tax Act this year with situations and examples. The guidelines are issued to remove difficulties in giving effect to the provisions introduced this year. Income Tax Act exempts any income received from an insurance policy including the bonus amount from tax. This year, this provision was modified to exclude insurance policies in which annual premium in any of the previous years was more than  ₹500,000. This was made in order to ensure that tax benefits meant for ordinary persons are not cornered by the super rich. “This provision was introduced to nullify the tax advantage given to investments disguised as insurance policies,” explained Amit Maheshwari, Tax Partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm. “Since this provision would impact many individuals, especially the rich, CBDT has issued guidelines to remove difficulties, which is a welcome move. The guidelines are elaborate and give various examples on the computation of consideration eligible for exemption,” said Maheshwari.

Six factors individuals with pre-existing conditions should be aware of while purchasing a plan,1 min read.25 Jul 2023,"Health Insurance: Healthcare costs are skyrocketing significantly. And, this is when health insurance comes in handy. The financial security of an individual is protected by having health insurance. With the ever-rising instances of diseases, health insurance today is a necessity. However, there are several things one needs to keep in mind at the time of purchasing health insurance. Experts advise people to disclose pre-existing conditions or diseases while buying a health insurance policy. It is important to keep in mind that insurers charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing illnesses. According to Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance while purchasing health insurance for an individual with pre-existing medical conditions, there are a few crucial factors that one needs to keep in mind. 1)First among them is to ensure that the Health Insurance policy covers the pre-existing ailment and its contingent/related conditions. 2)Secondly, a thorough understanding of the terms and conditions of the waiting period for the ailment is necessary. 3)The policyholder should read policy documents carefully and understand if any limitations or exclusions such as co-payment, sub-limit, or deductible apply to the pre-existing disease. 4) Some policies may not cover or have limits on coverage for certain procedures or treatment of these pre–existing ailments. Being aware of these limitations helps one make informed decisions about their health security. 5) Individuals with pre-existing diseases should declare all their medical conditions in the proposal form filing or during the process of underwriting. 6) Some people may have to pay a higher premium as compared to those without such conditions. Therefore, it becomes crucial for one to carefully compare premiums and terms & conditions across different insurers & products to find the best-suited plan at an affordable price. Awareness about these components can aid individuals in making informed choices while getting a health Insurance that not only covers their pre-existing diseases, but gives assured quality servicing at affordable prices – a truly Comprehensive Health Insurance plan, said Ajay Shah.

Ltd., the insurance regulator, on Friday, directed a take-over of the company’s all the 2 lakh-odd live insurance policies by India’s largest privately held life insurer SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Following a regulatory meeting on the issues plaguing Sahara India Life, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India or Irdai said in a release that the regulator has ordered an immediate transfer of Sahara’s life insurance business to SBI Life Insurance. “Upon reviewing Sahara India Life’s policy data, it has become apparent that the company's portfolio is experiencing a run-off trend,” said Irdai. Sahara India Life was started in 2004 as the first wholly Indian-owned life insurance firm by blotted entrepreneur Subroto Roy-promoted Sahara Group, whose entire business empire collapsed after India’s financial regulators caught Roy of swindling millions of investors through a bunch of ponzi schemes. Irdai’s Friday’s decision follows Sahara India Life’s failure to comply with the extant regulatory requirements and the insurer’s inability to take necessary steps to safeguard the interest of its policyholders, said the release by Irdai. Sahara India Life has faced “significant challenges regarding financial propriety and governance,” said the regulator. In 2017, due to these concerns, the Irdai had appointed an administrator to oversee the management of Sahara India Life, and had prohibited the insurer from underwriting any new business. “Despite numerous opportunities and ample time to rectify the situation, Sahara India Life Insurance has not addressed the issues adequately,” said Irdai. Irdai said Sahara India Life’s financial position has steadily deteriorated, with mounting losses and a higher percentage of claims in relation to total premium. “If this trend persists, it could lead to further capital erosion and Sahara India Life may not be able to discharge its liabilities towards policyholders, thereby endangering the interest of its policyholders,” said Irdai. Utilizing a special power under the Insurance Act, Irdai decided to transfer Sahara India Life’s insurance business to a suitable insurer (SBI Life Insurance) without delay. With a 7.98% market share SBI Life is the country’s largest private sector life insurer. For the fiscal 2023, SBI Life collected a new business premium of Rs. 29,587.60 crore, recording a 16.22% growth year-on-year. Irdai has formed a committee to ensure a seamless transition for all Sahara India Life’s policyholders. “This committee will be responsible for implementing Irdai's order within a specific timeframe. SBI Life has been instructed to take necessary measures to reach out to Sahara India Life policyholders, including establishing a dedicated cell to address their queries and publishing relevant details on its website,” said Irdai, adding that the insurance watchdog will be monitoring the situation closely.

But poorly designed workplaces can negatively impact the health of employees, especially those who are underrepresented--LGBTQAI+ communities, people with disabilities, and women. According to the report by Plum, a health insurance platform, acceptance for queer communities in the workplace is still in a nascent stage. People from the LGBTQAI+ communities are still witnessing discrimination including while renting houses, seeking jobs, getting insurance covers, opening bank accounts, etc. Nation Human Rights Commission's 2018 report highlighted that 96% of trans persons were denied jobs while 92% were denied participation in any economic activity. Additionally, policy terms such as HIV, Oral chemotherapy, mental health, maternity, and LGBTQAI coverage are not covered in the majority of the scenarios at workplaces. ""Diversity and inclusion are not about these (gender, sexuality, disabilities, etc) identities, it's a lot about who you are, where and how you can treat people and behave. What needs to happen is that you look at understanding who your workforce is and ask who is missing, not being seen, not being heard,"" Madhumita Venkataraman. Plum suggests companies craft health insurance policies that work for all kinds of employees and their dependents. According to Plum, for the LGBTQAI+ community, the policy should involve (gender reassignment, mental health, option for live-in partner coverage, and surrogacy)"" In India, gender reassignment surgeries cost anywhere between  ₹2 lakh to  ₹5 lakh for males and  ₹4 lakh to  ₹8 lakh for females. According to Plum, India's insurance penetration is just 4.2%, and pocket health expenses are 47% of the total health expenditure. "" Insurance coverage for elective surgeries is even more minuscule,"" the report said. ""A bad work culture impacts every employee and certain historically underrepresented groups suffer the most,"" Harish Iyer, Equal Right Activist. In the case of women staff, the representation is also abysmally low. According to Sebi's regulation, all listed companies need to have at least one woman as their board member. However, Excellent Enabler's survey of 100 listed Indian firms found that only 27% of firms have two or more independent women directors; 61% of companies have only one independent woman director while 12% have no woman director. Dr Saundarya Rajesh, Founder of Avtar Group said, "" Lack of diversity in leadership is one of the reasons behind women still being left behind. When leaders in an organisation are predominantly male, the inclusion of women can go ignored"". Plum's report suggested that companies must include terms like (egg freezing covers, IVF, maternity-related complications, and surrogacy) for women staff. Meesho offers 30 weeks of maternity leaves which can be extended by a few months, or up to a year. The startup also offers 30 days' leave for transitioning or gender reassignment surgery, covered under health insurance. The company's health insurance policy also includes terms like IVF and live-in partners. The company offers infertility coverage up to  ₹1 lakh. The policy comprises egg harvesting, freezing, and surrogacy with maternity benefits. WeWork also claims to have gender-neutral washrooms in the office.

Nearly 20 applications are awaiting approval with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), which has now set up a dedicated facilitation cell to support the registration application of companies and is providing on-tap no-objection certificates to fast-track approvals, an official familiar with the development said. About a dozen of these applicants may get a final nod to start insurance operations this year, the official said, requesting anonymity. In an emailed response, Irdai chairman Debasish Panda said that the business environment is favourable and conducive, and investors are attracted to the insurance sector, a sentiment underscored by the interest in new licences. “Few more applicants are in the pipeline at various stages of fulfilling the criteria for registration. These applicants are supported by dedicated facilitation cells of Irdai,” Panda said, without giving out the names of entities seeking insurance licences from the regulator. Earlier this year, the regulator approved the applications of two life insurance companies—Acko Life Insurance Ltd and Credit Access Life and Insurance Ltd— and a general insurer— Kshema General Insurance Ltd. For life insurance companies, these were the first approvals since 2011, while for general insurers, the last approval was in 2017. With the addition of new companies, there are now 25 life insurers and 34 general players operating in the country. “To attain the goal of ‘insurance for all’ by 2047, existing insurers need to scale up, new players must enter the sector, more distribution partners are required, more products are needed, and most importantly, usage of high-end technological solutions is a must,” the regulator said, highlighting the need to expand the insurance sector in the country by bringing in new players. “We need to tap the huge potential that exists in almost every line of business, be it life, health, personal accident, motor, property, etc. We also need to be prepared for new & emerging risks and innovative solutions required for the same,” Panda said. The Indian insurance market is the 10th largest globally, with the insurance industry registering a 13% growth during FY23. FDI in the insurance sector is about  ₹57,000 crore, with assets under management (AUM) growing by 11% in FY23 to reach  ₹60 trillion. As insurance penetration rises, the regulator expects the domestic insurance market to reach $200 billion by 2027. It has steadily increased from 2.7% in 2000 to 4.2% in 2020 and was 3.2% in 2021, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23 released in January. Rapid growth, coupled with its relatively low penetration, is attracting new investors. The post-pandemic period has accelerated market growth, with improved awareness about life and health insurance driving sales. The economic recovery and improved mobility have also boosted the demand for motor insurance. According to an Icra report, the general insurance industry’s GDPI (gross direct premium income) grew 17.2% from a year earlier in FY23 to  ₹2.4 trillion, buoyed by the resurgence of economic activities after the waning of covid-19 infections. A CareEdge report has also presented a positive picture of India’s life insurance market, with new business premiums or first-year premiums of companies growing by 17.9% in FY23 as against 12.9% growth in the previous year. The move towards lighter regulations, expedited processing and flexibility in raising capital has contributed to more companies vying to participate in the Indian insurance sector. Proposals to amend insurance laws to allow rationalized capital requirements, composite registration, one-time registration for intermediaries, value-added services by insurers, and the sale of other financial products, are currently under way to boost participation.

Further, ICRA projected that the insurance industry's gross direct premium would cross  ₹3 lakh crore mark by FY2025 as against  ₹2.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. According to the report, private insurers' combined ratio is likely to improve, and Return on Equity (RoE) is expected at 11.2-12.8% in FY2024 and 12.5-13.9% in FY2025. However, most of the PSU insurers are expected to witness a high combined ratio resulting in net losses, though it will be lower compared to the last few years, ICRA's report highlighted. It said that the capital requirement of three PSU general insurers (excluding New India) is estimated at a sizeable  ₹172-175 billion to meet a solvency of 1.50 times as of March 2024, assuming 100% forbearance from the regulator. Further, the report said that the health segment witnessed the sharpest growth, accounting for 48-50% of the incremental GDPI in FY2023. The auto segment also picked up pace after the Covid pandemic. The net claims ratio improved with the normalisation of health claims, partially offset by higher claims in the motor segment with increased vehicle movement, post-pandemic, ICRA said. However, the underwriting losses of public sector insurers increased because of wage revision and payment of associated arrears.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/insurance-premiums-to-turn-10-costlier-11683481899312.html,Insurance premiums to turn 10% costlier,3 min read.08 May 2023,"The insurance cost for Indian companies and motor vehicle owners is set to surge as global reinsurers, impacted by the war in Ukraine and other weather-related losses worldwide, have raised rates by 40-60%. The increase in reinsurance rates is expected to result in a minimum 10% rise in insurance premiums for properties, liabilities, marine, and motor covers in the coming months, top executives of Indian general insurers said. “The cost of reinsurance is expected to increase the property premiums by 8-10% across a few categories of risks. Similarly, we may witness an increase in motor and marine covers as well,” said Ritesh Kumar, managing director and chief executive of HDFC ERGO General Insurance Co. Ltd. India’s general insurance industry, comprising 24 companies and excluding standalone health and agriculture insurers, underwrote a gross premium of  ₹2.15 trillion during FY23, a 16% increase from the previous year. These insurers collectively hold 84% market share in the general insurance industry. Bhargav Dasgupta, managing director and CEO of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd, India’s largest private general insurer, said, “Extensive damages are happening, which in turn, increased the reinsurance costs for Indian insurers.” For India, reinsurance rates have risen roughly 40% and 60%, Dasgupta said. “Due to the exposure to catastrophe losses, (reinsurance) rates have gone up, which affects all lines of business—factories, properties, motor, everything it affects. The lines that got affected more are the commercial lines, for corporates,” Dasgupta said. HDFC Ergo’s Kumar stated that about 50% of the premiums for property and liability lines of business at the industry level are reinsured. Indian companies buy large insurance covers to mitigate the impact of unforeseen liabilities and catastrophic losses. They typically buy insurance cover to protect against fire, marine-related risks, engineering, and business interruptions. Motor insurance is, however, mandatory for all vehicle owners in India. Motor insurance alone contributed  ₹81,292 crore in premiums to the general insurance industry’s total business in FY2023. With the latest rise in reinsurance costs, the premium rates for buying insurance for vehicles such as passenger cars, bikes and commercial vehicles are likely to go up by 10-15% in the next few months, according to industry experts. At  ₹8,582 crore, ICICI Lombard’s motor business alone contributed around 40% of the company’s total premium in FY2023. The insurer’s total premium grew by 17% in FY23. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), during FY23, general insurers underwrote a total fire insurance premium of  ₹23,933 crore, marine insurance premium of  ₹5,058 crore, engineering insurance premium of  ₹4,281 crore, aviation insurance premium of  ₹889 crore and a liability insurance premium of  ₹4,863 crore. General insurers’ liability portfolio comprises insurance cover against workmen’s compensation, employers’ liability, public liability, product liability and other liability covers. HDFC Ergo’s Kumar said since central banks in Western countries have increased interest rates by 4.5-5% over the last 12 months, increasing the cost of capital for global reinsurers. Further, Kumar said the climate change uncertainty had gone up in recent years, leading to huge losses for the reinsurers.“Even though there has been a limited impact of catastrophes in India, the reinsurance cost for catastrophic covers has increased significantly during the year. In lieu of this, a significant impact is expected on the premiums for property and engineering risks, especially for flood cover,” Kumar said. He said that major reinsurers providing reinsurance capacities in India are based in Europe and the US. Globally, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Hannover Re, SCOR (France), Partner Re, Everest Re, Lloyd’s and Reinsurance Group of America are the top reinsurance firms. “A couple of events happened in the Ukraine war, which has increased the losses for the industry. The reinsurance rates have gone up also because of the climate change and the related losses that we are seeing,” said Dasgupta, whose company underwrote a total gross premium of  ₹21,025 crore for FY23, the highest among private players, commanding a market share of 8.2% in the general insurance industry.“The Western world, particularly, has had a series of catastrophe losses, and that has had a significant financial impact on the reinsurance market, according to ICICI Lombard’s Dasgupta. “At the same time, because of inflation, interest rates are going up, their (reinsurers’) investment book had had some hits. So the interest rates globally have gone up. Even this year for India also, for all of us in the market, reinsurance rates have gone up,” Dasgupta said.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/nonlife-insurance-industry-grows-over-16-driven-by-health-and-motor-insurance-11683369210509.html,Non-life insurance industry grows over 16% driven by health and motor insurance,3 min read.06 May 2023,"Driven by a pick-up in health and motor insurance segments, the non-life insurance industry has grown by 16.4% in FY23 compared to 11.1% in the previous year, an industry report on the insurance industry said. Except for a blip in September 2022, the report by CareEdge said that the segment is on a roll reporting double-digit growth for the month of March 2023 continuing the FY23 trend. The industry reported a premium of  ₹24,271.4 crore for March 2023, an 11.5% growth y-o-y, the rating agency said in its report. General insurers’ March 2023 numbers were up by 9.7%, compared to an increase of 13.8% in March 2022, while for FY23, the growth which has been driven by the group health and motor segments, has been twice of what was witnessed last year, said the report. According to it, standalone private health insurers (SAHI) continued to move on their growth curve as March 2023 numbers touched  ₹3,428.4 crore up from  ₹2,829.9 crore in March 2022 and  ₹2,319.8 crore in February 2023. This monthly growth of 21.2% was higher than the 15.6% reported in March 2022 albeit the growth rate declined sequentially from 26.8% in February 2023. Meanwhile, the FY23 growth rate too was slower in the current year versus last year. The slowing was on account of the normalised growth in the government and retail health schemes in the current year, while last year, the same had posted significant growth, CareEdge said. Specialised insurers posted an increase of 16.2% in March 2023 compared to a drop of 18.3% in March 2022, meanwhile, FY23 numbers have remained subdued, growing at 5.3% vs. 14.7% in FY22. Observing the FY23 numbers, private players grew by 2.2 times their public counterparts given their strong market presence and relatively better solvency levels. The market share of private non-life insurance companies has witnessed a sustained increase to 62% in FY23 from 59% in FY22 and 57% in FY21. For the month of March 2023, the trend continued with private companies reporting higher growth of 14.8% while public sector non-life insurance companies posted a growth of 5.8%, said the report. CareEdge estimates that the Indian non-life insurance market would grow by approximately 13-15% over the medium term. The health insurance segment is on track to breach the  ₹1 lakh crore mark, while motor insurance premiums will cross  ₹85,000 crore in FY24 given the fact that they have already crossed  ₹90,000 crore and  ₹80,000 crore mark respectively during the last year, the ratings agency said. The growth would be driven by the popularity of health insurance products/schemes, growing demand for motor insurance (Third party & Owner damage) products, expected rise in per capita / disposable income levels, a greater volume of transactions under segments such as fire, marine, export credit, customised products, especially in motor and health insurance and gradual introduction of new products. According to the rating agency, insurance companies will aim to improve their profitability by stabilising the loss ratios that were affected by the pandemic. They plan to control management expenses in compliance with regulations, and strengthen their distribution networks by adding more partners and using digital and online channels. The agency also anticipates continued growth in investment yields due to rising interest rates and the availability of growth capital, which will help support the companies' growth in the future. The companies are anticipated to make significant investments in digital enablement across all distribution channels, including expanding their online/digital channels to simplify the insurance purchase process. They will also boost their underwriting capacities with automated/AI-based underwriting while keeping a focus on cost improvement to maintain margins. Although the outlook is expected to remain stable in the medium term, the agency warns that intensified competition, an uncertain geopolitical environment, and high inflation could negatively impact economic growth and, subsequently, the non-life insurance sector., the agency said.

In terms of the sheer volume, no other company matches the insurance giant. In terms of premiums collected, it continues to hold a market share of 62.58 per cent as on March 2023. According to the Life Insurance Council data, private insurers have also collected a considerable amount of premium in March due to last-minute customer rush to benefit ahead of the April 1 withdrawal of tax exemptions for non-linked policies. LIC's premium growth for fiscal 2023 is the second highest among its listed peers, with HDFC Life leading with 18.83 per cent, SBI Life at 16.22 per cent and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company at 12.55 per cent. In FY23 while the insurance giants' individual single premium grew 3.30 per cent and individual non-single premium grew 10 per cent, its group single premium grew 21.76 per cent to  ₹1,67,235 crore from  ₹1,37,350.36 crore. For March 2023, LIC's premium for the individual category exceeds  ₹10,000 crore, the highest amongst all life insurance companies, followed by HDFC Life, SBI Life and Tata AIA Life gathering  ₹2,989.17 crore,  ₹2,318.77 crore and  ₹1,884.41 crore, respectively. In the individual non-single premium segment, it grew 10.49 per cent from  ₹5,501.12 crore in March 2022 to  ₹6,077.97 crore in March 2023. According to a report published in January by Kotak Institutional Equities, listed insurers are expected to deliver a 15-60 per cent growth in their value of the new business for fourth quarter (Q4 FY23) due to improvement in term business, nonpar business, and better operating leverage. Broking firm Motilal Oswal in its February 2023 report initiated a ""buy"" call on the LIC's share with a target price of  ₹830 per share post their Q3 FY23 results update and on basis of September FY24E (Estimates) of 0.8 times Enterprise Value.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/irdais-new-rules-on-commission-payments-give-insurers-more-flexibility-to-manage-their-expenses-11680011847465.html,IRDAI’s new rules on commission payments give insurers more flexibility to manage their expenses,3 min read.28 Mar 2023,"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has approved new rules on the payment of commissions to insurance agents or insurance intermediaries by insurers. Under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, 2023, notified on 26 March 2023, the insurance regulator has replaced the earlier individual cap on commission payments on insurance products with an overall cap on expenses of management of insurers. The rule is applicable for life and non-life insurers (general and standalone health insurers). Hence, the move can provide more flexibility to insurers in managing their expenses. These regulations will come into force from 1 April 2023 and will be reviewed once every three years. The move will benefit policyholders: The IRDAI announced some important regulatory changes, which is good for policy buyers and the insurance industry, i.e., the revised Expenses of Management (EOM) and commission limits for the industry. Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, “We firmly believe that the shift from product level commissions to a company-wide limit of expenses, as proposed through the proposed regulations, will ensure parity across varying business models while rendering greater flexibility in managing expenses for insurers. Moreover, with the majority of the insurers above the prescribed norms of expenses and with the industry reeling with a combined ratio of more than 118%, these EOM limits will help in bringing cost discipline and take the industry in the right direction of prudency and profitability. This should hence translate into better pricing and products for customers in the medium to long term.” Anil Kumar Aggarwal, MD and CEO at Shriram General Insurance, echoed the industry’s sentiments, “The removal of the cap on commission payments will positively impact the insurance sector. It will facilitate greater product innovation, development of new product distribution models and lead to more customer-centric operations. It will also increase insurance penetration and provide flexibility to insurers in managing their expenses. Overall, it will smoothen adherence to compliance norms.” The move will benefit the Distribution-led business model: The revised regulations will provide an extra expense allowance for Insurtech expenses, spending on insurance awareness, and rural and social schemes of the government, etc. Abhishek Bondia, principal officer and managing director of SecureNow.in, said, “This is a positive move for the industry and boosts insurance penetration. Distribution-led business models would likely attract more investments. Insurers would be more able to incentivise reach for priority segments such as individual protection plans, commercial insurance for small businesses, and tier-2 cities. According to the IRDAI notification, these regulations‘ objectives are to enhance the regulation’s responsiveness to market innovation. To facilitate the insurers in developing new business models, products, strategies, internal processes and enable easy compliance with the Regulations while fulfilling the regulatory objectives. And to provide the insurers with the flexibility to manage their expenses based on their growth aspirations and the ever-changing insurance needs with an objective to improve insurance penetration. However, clarity around the total allowable expenses of management, including commission and operating costs for the insurer, is still awaited. Mayank Gupta - Co-Founder and COO of Zopper, said, “The authorities are clearly moving the system towards a more transparent environment and encouraging flexibility. With only top limits being defined, the market will move towards more vigorous negotiations and encourage the best deals to surface. The customers will surely have more robust, well-designed, cost-effective product offerings by stable organisations they can trust in the long run.” N. S. Kannan, managing director & CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said, ""The increased flexibility in commission limits will allow insurers to react to market forces in a quicker manner, thereby supporting the IRDAI’s vision of improving penetration of insurance in the country. The expenses of management have increased allowability in the later years of the policy while limiting expenses in the initial year. This will persuade insurers to work on improving long-term persistency, which in turn will improve the customer proposition as well as the Company’s profitability.""

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/motor-health-and-term-insurance-witnessed-high-demand-amongst-corporate-employees-survey-11679318424846.html,"Motor, health, and term insurance witnessed high demand amongst corporate employees: survey",2 min read.20 Mar 2023,"In a recent survey by Elephant.in on insurance being brought by corporate employees in India, the organisation shared some interesting facts regarding the growing demand in this category. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative effects on the global and national economies and health systems, its single but most powerful positive effect was to raise awareness of the value of insurance. According to the survey, while the health and life insurance categories have seen significant growth in the personal insurance segment, the pandemic has also increased awareness and acceptance of Health and Term Life insurance in the corporate insurance segment. Likewise, motor insurance has witnessed high demand from corporate employees as well. Also, there is a rising need to understand individual corporate insurance among businesses, employees, and other stakeholders. The benefits offered by companies are fixed in the standard group insurance model, there is little room for personalisation, and the programme expires once the employee leaves the company. Businesses are shifting to offering employees personalised employee insurance solutions where they can take advantage of exclusive benefits, prices and features that are available only to them. At the same time, the global recession has made corporate employees rethink about the benefits they receive from their organisations. In a situation like this, the response towards individual employee insurance, where the benefits are linked to the corporate, but stay the same way, even if the employee is no longer associated with the organization has been in huge demand. In the last year, 250+ companies with close to 500,000 employees opted for personalised employee insurance policies through Elephant.in. The demand for this kind of insurance is growing fast, not only in the metro cities but also in Tier 2/3 cities. People within the age group of 31 - 40 years have been the largest users of individual employee insurance. One interesting part of the survey outcome has been the high usage of individual employee insurance among women. While men still continue to hold the larger share of employee insurance buyers, there has been a consistent growth trajectory amongst women in this category. Working women consist of around 33% of the women’s population and 23% of traffic at Elephant.in have been female in the last year. Women hold a significant population, and many of them are moving towards decision-making. Thus, this is a very heartening ratio, as it projects growing awareness and the buying decision amongst women for insurance. There is also some movement in the start-up ecosystem towards individual employee insurance. However, more and more start-ups need to join the individual employee insurance bandwagon. Start-ups today value the contribution of their employees and go to the extreme extent of retaining their star performers. Individual employee insurance is a significant tool for hiring and retaining employees for the longer term. The survey reveals that, although individual employee insurance is growing in the country, more and more organisations, as well as employees, need to know about the benefits of this unique proposition. In traditional group insurance, the benefits are fixed, there is minimal customisation, and the insurance ends once the employee ends their tenure with the organisation. In individual employee insurance products, the insurance options, as well as benefits, are equivalent to individual insurance policies. Added to this, employees can avail of insurance policies at the best prices, compared to the premiums available in the open market.

Hassle-free repairs in case of any accident resulting in damage to the vehicle. You can also get value-added services: many dealers provide financing facilities and motor insurance coverage through tie-ups with banks, non-banking financial companies and insurers. While all these can give you a seamless car-buying experience, you should be careful while opting for a motor insurance policy. Here are the advantages and demerits of buying a policy from a car dealer. Convenience: You can get your car and vehicle insurance in one place. You don’t have to go through the hassle of finding an insurance provider. Customisation: A car dealer will likely know your vehicle and its specifications. They can help you get insurance policies best suited to your car. Further, you can get personalised service from car dealers, including assistance on insurance claims and other related services. Gopakumar Pillai, head of automotive partnerships at Digit Insurance, said, “Car dealers may offer customized insurance policies that are tailored to your specific needs, such as zero depreciation cover, engine protection, and roadside assistance.” Limited options: Car dealers typically offer limited insurance policies. Some may not even allow you to compare policies from different providers. Pillai said, “When you buy insurance from a car dealer, you might not get the option to compare and choose from various products.” Raghavendra Rao, chief distribution officer of Future Generali India Insurance, said, “The price and cover comparisons providing multiple insurer options may not be available at all car dealers. This limits the flexibility that the customers must have while buying/renewing their motor insurance.” Higher premiums: Car dealers usually charge high commissions on insurance policies. Rakesh Goyal, director, Probus Insurance Broker, said, “Car dealers have a financial incentive to sell you motor insurance, which can create a conflict of interest. They may prioritize their profits over your best interests.” Lack of transparency: Car dealers may not provide complete information about their insurance policies. Rao said, “You may miss out on the advice agents and other intermediaries give while buying insurance.” What to do? Check out the offerings from various insurers.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/retail-health-insurance-market-can-give-20-roe-yearly-11674578963973.html,‘Retail health insurance market can give 20% RoE yearly’,3 min read.31 Jan 2023,"India’s retail health insurance sector has the potential to give a 20% yearly return on equity (RoE), according to a report by Avendus Capital, even as the sector has seen a surge in demand fuelled by a rise in policy purchases by families and individuals post covid. The retail health insurance segment covers only health insurance policies that are bought by individuals or families. The report, “Retail Health Insurance: A Large Whitespace,” has also forecast a market size of $25 billion for this space by FY27, a 5.3x jump from the $4 billion recorded in FY22. “In India, the health retail health insurance segment is currently dominated by five standard health insurers (SAHIs): Religare-led Care Health Insurance, Niva (Max) Bupa Health Insurance, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, Star Health and Allied Insurance and ManipalCigna Health Insurance,” the report by the investment banking firm further noted. These entities have disrupted the market to capture over 50% share and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of growth within the segment, the study said, adding that these companies have received significant interest from global and domestic investors alike in the past. For instance, last year, Aditya Birla Health Insurance bagged  ₹665 crore from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) while Religare Enterprises Ltd was in the process of raising  ₹300 crore for Care Health Insurance via a rights issue. “SAHIs have established a presence in the retail health segment. Awareness of health insurance post-Covid has acted as a strong catalyst. Given that the distribution of retail health is primarily individual agent driven, SAHIs’ single product focus and distribution arbitrage over multi-line insurers provide them with a competitive advantage,” said Snigdha Khemka, director - consumer, financial institutions group (FIG) and business services, Avendus Capital. For investors, retail health insurance will continue to be one of the most exciting segments within the overall non-life insurance or general insurance space. Anshul Agarwal, managing director and co-head, consumer, FIG and business services at Avendus Capital, is of the view that the segment will continue to see significant investments due to high persistency rate, relatively low loss ratio and headroom for growth due to low penetration. “The ability to generate consistently high profits and RoE of over 20% would account for sustained investor appetite due to limited opportunities in companies which focus purely on the retail health segment,” said Agarwal. The report also pointed out that since approximately 45% of India’s relevant population is currently devoid of any health coverage, the retail health insurance segment is expected to be the leader among other non-life segments. According to the report, low penetration (with only 60 million individuals covered), coupled with a Covid-led rise in awareness, product innovation, rising disposable income etc. are some of the key catalysts for growth in the retail health segment, where coverage is expected to reach about 250 million individuals.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/mint-beshak-insurance-ratings-11654771446816.html,Mint Beshak Insurance Ratings,5 min read.01 Aug 2023,"With numerous products, plan options, and all the complicated fine print, comparing and choosing health insurance can be quite a daunting task. To simplify and empower quicker decision-making, Mint in association with Beshak.org, an unbiased insurance discovery platform presents Mint Beshak Insurance Ratings. This rating zooms into the most essential aspects of insurance plans blurring out the frills to present a refreshed version 2.0 of our erstwhile Mediclaim rating Detailed methodology: Here’s a detailed note on the methodology followed for rating insurance plans. Mint Beshak Insurance Rating - Health Insurance is a blended measure of product and claims experience track record of insurance companies. In the health insurance rating, we basically measure the product promises (in form of product benefits) and the delivery track record (in form of claims track record) of each health insurance plan offered online by insurance companies. The final Mint Health insurance rating of a plan is done after applying the following weights: 1.1 Product Rating: Under Product Rating, the following core cover and condition parameters under health insurance are scored (out of five) by a relative scoring method, post which the following weights are applied to factor the importance of each of these subparameters. Parameters are selected based on the core impact they are likely to make on actual hospitalization claims in the long run for individuals and families. 1.2 Claims Track Record Rating: Under Claims Track Record Rating, insurers are rated on the relative scoring and weights of the following important parameters captured under various public disclosures. These parameters measure the experience insurers have provided in the past to their customer. 2. Premium Affordability Rating: Premium affordability is an important independent measure for customers to do an objective cost-benefit analysis before customers make a final choice on the product. An independent affordability rating helps compare the value offered by a product (through product and experience) against the pricing. Based on our research, the median age of customers buying health insurance is 30 years. We measure the relative affordability of the plans on a like-to-like basis for the following standard requirements. Age: 30 Years Type of Policy: Floater Family Construct: Self + Spouse + 1 Kid Cover: Rs. 10 Lakhs The following points must be noted when you are reading the above rating and methodology: For calculating the ratings, we have aggregated data from the products brochures, policy wordings, prospectus on respective insurance company's website The claims data is as on 31st December 2022, the latest available on the IRDAI website at the time of the study. The rating has been calculated based on product benefits, conditions available as on 17th February 2023. Any modifications on the product after 17th February 2023 have not been included. These will be considered in the coming financial quarter. The study has used relative scoring (values across each parameter are relatively compared across insurers and converted into a relative score) to rate various subparameters. The cumulative score for a parameter has been calculated using weighted average of all sub parameters. The weights used are based on the impact of the specific sub-parameter on the risk being covered. IRDAI had made it mandatory for every insurance company to offer Modern Treatment benefits. In case any insurance company has not mentioned specifically that they cover this and they have not defined any sub-limits for every treatment, we have considered that all modern treatment procedures are covered without any sub-limits. The sorting of products for ratings is based on two places of decimal. In Acko’s Platinum Health Plan, we have considered their Inflation Protection benefit instead of the No Claim Bonus Benefit. Premium is not a part of overall Product Ratings. It has been decoupled from the rating of products, as we find affordability very subjective and personal. Readers can compare the benefits (overall rating) and the price (price rating) based on their personal preferences to take informed actions. Premiums compared are standard annual premiums for a Rs. 10 Lakh cover for a family of 2 adults (30-year-old) and one child (1 year old), living in Mumbai. Premium calculations include additional premiums for optional riders. Premiums are taken as on 24th February 2023. Premium affordability rating has been calculated by relative comparison of each product to the median average premium of the products under study. Premiums affordability rating is indicative. Some products may have benefits beyond the scope of the rating methodology and hence be rated expensive as compared to other plans. 26 Insurance Companies, 39 products, and 53 plan variants that are actively distributed online by the insurance company or aggregators were selected for the study. Plans that offered 10 Lakhs floater sum insured were considered. We have not included the product offered by Navi Insurance because, at the time of our study, we found inconsistencies in what they are offering on their application vs what they are offering in their product's prospectus and policy wording. While we have rated all plan variants provided by the insurance company, for simplicity, we have displayed only the top-rated plan variant under a product in the above rating. Our goal with Mint Beshak Insurance Ratings is to empower you to find the best plans available in the market from 100s of plans and variants. We hope this was helpful. We will keep updating this rating every quarter based on fresh product information and disclosure data available. Reasons for the movement of ratings - We have updated the claims data. The data is as of 31st December 2022, the latest available at the time of this study. In the last published rating, the data was till 30th September 2022. We have updated the product information (benefits, conditions, and limits) wherever product changes were made. The product data is as on 17th February 2023. In the last published rating, the data was till 18th November 2022. We have included new products and plan options in the ratings launched up to 17th February 2023. We have removed the old products and plan options from the ratings that the insurance companies have stopped selling online.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/5-common-mistakes-to-avoid-while-choosing-a-term-insurance-policy-life-insurance-11742543465631.html,5 common mistakes to avoid while choosing a term insurance policy,2 min read.21 Mar 2025,"You need to choose the right term insurance policy to provide for your family. Still, it is important to ensure that you don’t make avoidable errors such as: inadequate coverage, hazy policy terms, higher premiums, vague add ons etc. This should be kept in mind so that you don’t end up with unfair premium pricing, inadequate cover or miss out important add on options. The following are five errors which need to be avoided while choosing a term insurance policy in India: The biggest error is underestimating your coverage requirements. Most individuals apply thumb rules or seek guidance from someone else without considering their own financial situation, like pending loans, day-to-day expenses, and long-term aspirations. Now it makes sense to work out your sum assured necessary based on your family needs and liabilities and keep them appropriately covered in case something untoward happens to you. As a general rule most financial advisers suggest a coverage of at-least 10-15 times your annual income. While the focus of applicants is always on trying to get the lowest possible premiums on their policies still, purchasing the policy just because of low rates is not the best practice to imbibe. It is important to acknowledge that low-cost policies either come with lesser cover or with huge exclusions. There has to be an equilibrium between the policy premium along with the benefits and add-ons of the term insurance policy. Further, each add-on feature, add-on benefit, and claim settlement ratio has to be carefully examined so that you don't miss out on core fundamental parameters and proper coverage. Most people do not factor in important riders and fine points of their term insurance policies. There are several crucial riders that provide additional cover to complement the term insurance policies. Some of the riders such as: critical illness cover or accidental death cover can provide the additional cover for a reasonable extra premium. Not opting for this cover puts your loved ones at a disadvantage by denying them critical add-on coverage. Choosing a shorter tenure in your policy could appear to be a sensible step but can easily land you in severe financial trouble in future. That is why consider going for a policy with adequate coverage and a longer tenure. It has been seen that individuals possibly don’t buy a term insurance policy until significant landmarks in their lives are achieved such as: until retirement or until their children are financially independent. That is why in your case you must choose a term that insures you properly into the future and keeps things under control. This is another critical mistake that aspirational policy holders make, that is providing incomplete information. Now, inaccurate or incomplete information submitted during the application may lead to a denial of future claims. All the medical facts, past history, accurate age etc must be disclosed because the insurer uses such information to determine the risk. Inconsistencies in this particular domain can ruin your family's financial security when they are most in need. Therefore, to conclude, by eliminating such mistakes, you can make sure that you opt for a term insurance policy that actually covers your family's needs and also provides you with peace of mind.

Any increase beyond this limit will now require prior approval from the regulator. While this step enhances transparency and predictability for policyholders, industry experts caution that it could lead to stricter policy issuance, tougher claim settlements, and a potential shift of costs to younger policyholders. ""The insurers shall not revise the premium for senior citizens by more than 10% per annum,"" Irdai stated in a circular issued on Thursday. It also specified two key scenarios requiring prior consultation: if an insurer intends to hike premiums beyond the 10% cap or withdraw an individual health insurance product for senior citizens. Read this | Why senior citizens require deductibles in health plans The decision comes in response to concerns over insurers imposing excessive premium hikes on senior citizens—sometimes doubling their existing premiums—making it increasingly difficult for them to afford continued coverage. Industry leaders welcomed the move, emphasizing its consumer-friendly approach. ""Our focus has always been on delivering value-driven insurance solutions, and hence, we fully support these reforms and remain committed to protecting our customers with transparent and sustainable products,"" said Aashish Sethi, Head - Health SBU and Travel, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Mahavir Chopra, founder of Beshak.org, also acknowledged the positive intent of the Irdai directive, saying the move will porvide clarity to senior citizens clarity on how much their premiums may increase, which is a welcome step. Read this | Mistakes people make when porting a health insurance policy ""Not sure, however, if the announcement has come with or without out industry consultation. We have seen in the past that quick decisions by the regulator have led to insurers finding a work-around to solve their own share of problems. We need to see how insurers react to the circular,"" said Chopra. Despite the relief the new cap provides, experts warn of unintended consequences. Chopra outlined three key risks that policyholders may face: Annual 10% hikes becoming the norm – Insurers may automatically raise premiums by 10% every year, even when lower increases might be justified. Stricter underwriting for senior citizens – Insurance providers could become more selective in issuing policies, making it harder for seniors to get coverage. Tougher claim settlements – Higher claim rejection rates or stringent scrutiny could emerge as insurers try to mitigate potential losses. Narendra Kumar Bharindwal, director and vice president at the Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI), further warned that the new regulation could make it difficult for senior citizens to switch insurers. New insurers may be reluctant to onboard high-risk profiles, or they may impose hefty premiums on those porting their policies, he explained. Read this | Health insurance with no premium hikes: Should you buy such plans? He also noted that younger policyholders might indirectly bear the financial burden. “If insurers make losses in 60+ profiles, they might pass on the premium hike to the younger population to make up for it."" Beyond premium regulation, the Irdai circular also addresses rising hospitalization costs. It directs private insurers to take steps toward a common empanelment of hospitals and negotiate package rates akin to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) scheme. The regulator highlighted the disparity between public and private insurance models, stating: “Unlike PMJAY, for package rates and are thus standardised across various hospitals, there is no such standardisation in case of health insurance products. This is leading to higher hospitalization costs resulting in higher claims outgo under health insurance products offered by insurers.” However, experts have mixed views on the feasibility of this approach. Bharindwal pointed out that while government schemes like PMJAY and CGHS (Central Government Health Scheme) operate with standardized rates, private insurers cater to diverse customer preferences and offer varying features. “A hospital may subsidise rates for general ward patients, but not for those who opt for suite or private room. The government will always have better negotiating power on rates which hospitals accept, but it does not happen with insurers,” he said. Sethi, however, believes that moving toward standardized pricing will bring much-needed stability. Encouraging insurers and hospitals to collaborate on standardizing packages and pricing will enhance transparency, cost efficiency, and fairness, he said.

While Irdai’s move marks a step toward greater predictability in premium pricing and cost efficiency in healthcare, its success will depend on how insurers implement these regulations.

At the Mint BFSI Summit and Awards 2025 in Mumbai on Friday, industry executives outlined the transformative potential of Bima Sugam, expecting that it will help both new-age and traditional insurers take their products to the country’s remotest corners. Bima Sugam will “certainly help increase awareness about digital insurance, which will benefit all insurtech players in the country”, said Rajiv Gupta, president of PB Fintech Ltd, the parent company of online insurance marketplace PolicyBazaar. Bima Sugam will instill much-needed consumer confidence in online insurance purchases, he said. Vishal Gupta, chief executive of PhonePe Insurance, echoed Rajiv Gupta’s sentiment, drawing parallels between Bima Sugam and the transformative success of UPI—the widely used unified payments interface that enables real-time bank transfers. Bima Sugam “can enable the entire ecosystem and expand the insurance market”, Vishal Gupta said, adding that the platform can empower a diverse range of players, from online disruptors to traditional offline agents. Mayank Bathwal, CEO of Aditya Birla Health Insurance, highlighted Bima Sugam's potential to address the critical issue of trust in the insurance industry. “As an independent entity, Bima Sugam can play a crucial role in increasing awareness, driving consideration, and facilitating seamless fulfillment for consumers,” he said, adding that the platform’s transparency and trustworthiness would be key towards achieving the government’s ambition of insurance for all by 2047. Rajiv Gupta of PB Fintech also emphasized the platform’s ability to streamline processes, empower agents, and bring much-needed transparency to the system. “A centralized platform like Bima Sugam will remove the silos and coordination challenges that customers face today, making it easier to file claims and manage policies,” he said. Vishal Gupta said if Bima Sugam “can enable innovation and reach across various interfaces and geographies, it will be a game-changer”. Bathwal highlighted the platform’s potential to eliminate information asymmetry and reduce distribution costs, ultimately benefiting consumers. “Bima Sugam can help us create more personalized and efficient offerings, as it will have access to valuable data and consent-based information,” he said. The discussion at the Mint BFSI Summit also went in-depth on the role of technology in enhancing insurance services. While Rajiv Gupta of PB Fintech noted that tech-driven efficiencies could lead to more personalized products and better financial literacy, particularly in underserved regions, Vishal Gupta of PhonePe Insurance emphasizing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in improving distribution, reaching the “missing middle”, and enabling error-free pricing. The “missing middle” in insurance refers to the population that doesn’t fall in the category of either low-income people covered under various government schemes or those who can afford to buy their own insurance. On concerns about ensuring Bima Sugam’s accessibility and efficiency for rural customers, Vishal Gupta said digital platforms had already proven their ability to reach tier two and tier three cities, citing PhonePe’s own sales statistics.

Allowing 100% FDI in insurance may not only open the floodgates for offshore capital to enter India but also facilitate the entry of new foreign insurers, helping the country enhance insurance penetration to achieve the government’s goal of “Insurance for all by 2047”. There are 26 life and 32 general insurers in India, with most private sector players operating through a joint venture with a foreign partner. “When we talk about insurance for all by 2047, it really means every individual has at least a health policy, a life insurance policy, and a property policy that covers his home and his business. Most recently there is a proposal from the government to increase FDI insurance to 100%. Irdai is working on it,” Sood said. The regulator increased the FDI limit in insurance from 49% to 74% in 2021. The plan to raise it further aligns with its goal to widen the reach of insurance so every Indian citizen in the country is covered by some type of insurance by 2047. “Irdai is working on increasing the number of players in the country so that there is a deeper penetration and we can expect more and more coverage,” said Sood. The Irdai member added that the government could help enhance insurance coverage in the country by incentivizing offering tax benefits or subsidies. Also read | Is a GST rate cut for insurance good news? At the Mint BFSI Summit, Sood urged the insurance industry to rethink their distribution models to ensure a deeper market penetration, as well as to develop new products to address different needs and risks. Over the past two years, Irdai has reformed the product use and file process to encourage innovation in the insurance industry, he said, adding that a key innovation to enhance insurance penetration without increasing mis-selling was Irdai’s introduction of the “consumer information sheet”. “This document gives in very simple terms the coverage (and) the key points of the insurance policy that make the policyholder aware of what he is going to buy,” Sood said. “There are always a lot of grievances that the customer doesn’t know what he is buying since the details are in the fine print. This is specifically in that direction to address the issue and make clear to the customer what insurance he is buying.” Another key initiative is Bima Sugam—“an electronic insurance marketplace which aims at bringing all stakeholders in the value chain on one platform”. Sood said Bima Sugam was launched to align with the regulator’s ambition to increase efficiency, improve transparency, make more products available, enhance services, deepen penetration, and make claims settlement easier to get India closer to insurance for all by 2047. Also read | India’s self-employed: Bridging the insurance gap with tech-enabled solutions Sood also urged India’s insurance industry to enhance health insurance coverage in the country. The insurance regulator has made cashless settlements, pre-authorization within one hour of request, and discharge of post-authorization duties within three hours of claim mandatory. “There are penalties if the insurer fails to adhere to these norms. These measures are meant to make the claim process easy in health insurance. It is supported by a robust grievance handling mechanism,” said Sood. He added that while government schemes have covered a vast lower-income population and people with high income are able to afford insurance, the industry was missing out on the mass in the middle. “We have to work towards bringing a new approach, customised products, and developing new methodologies for distribution across new types of groups and do whatever it takes to address this missing middle-income group. Otherwise, a vast population remains without health insurance coverage,” said Sood. Also read | Insurers may get to sell related non-insurance value added products and services but not MFs Sood also highlighted the need for more domestic reinsurers amid emerging geopolitical risks and increasing natural disasters. “... there is decreasing capacity in the reinsurance market. We need to work on ways to increase domestic capacity, which can be brought about by the introduction of new players,” he said. Sood added that the industry needed to rethink ways to handle the “increasing number and severity of natural catastrophic events”. “We need to build capacity and new kinds of parametric products, which will make it easier for people to not only take insurance against these perils but also to be able to claim when such natural catastrophes strike,” Sood said. “We need to expand reinsurance capacity in this market so that we are able to handle more and more such events and be self-reliant.” Also read | A tech solution to crop insurance woes? Sood added that Irdai was working towards introducing a risk-based capital regime. “This will benefit both insurers and the market and assign capital to the appropriate risk. As we see more and more complex risks coming in, insurers will be able to better utilize and manage their capital.” He also urged insurers in India to work on better ways to deal with cyber risks. “The worst thing about cyber risk is it is not known where does it start and where does it attack,” said Sood. “We are carrying devices in our pockets and that is the way we are exposing ourselves to these risks. We have to develop methods to safeguard against these kind of risks.” With the evolution of quantum computing the face of such risk will again change “and it will be upon us in a much more complex way”, the Irdai member said. “We need to build measures to protect each individual, and if you are struck by it you see that you are protected through insurance.” Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

These guidelines emphasize transparency, ease of documentation, and policyholder protection, ensuring fair treatment in claim processing. There is also a mention that no claim shall be rejected or closed for want of documents or for delayed intimation. Insurers are mandated to provide a written explanation for claim rejections. Carefully examine this document to understand the reasons and whether it aligns with your policy terms. This clarity will help you make the necessary corrections. The 2024 Irdai guidelines aim to simplify documentation requirements, ensuring policyholders are not burdened with unnecessary paperwork. Insurers are required to demand only essential documents directly relevant to the claim. Standardized checklists must be provided at the time of policy issuance. Insurers must assist policyholders in identifying missing documents and guide them to ensure claims can be processed without delay. Insurers cannot reject a claim solely for minor document-related discrepancies if the material facts of the claim are established. Common documents needed: (i) Hospital bills and discharge summaries; (ii) Doctor’s prescription and treatment records; (iii) Investigation reports (e.g., X-rays, blood tests, etc.); (iv) Claim form and policy copy; (v) Loss-assessment report; and (vi) Bills or receipts for property repairs or replacement. Submit a formal complaint through the insurer’s grievance redressal mechanism. Insurers must resolve grievances within 15 days. Ensure you receive an acknowledgement of your complaint for tracking. You can also contact the Irdai Bima Bharosa site in case you are not happy with the grievance redressal officer's response. If unresolved, escalate to the Insurance Ombudsman for impartial resolution. Shilpa Arora is co-founder and chief operating officer at Insurance Samadhan.

The detection of multiple HMPV cases in India has put government authorities on their toes. While experts term the HMPV surge seasonal, rising viral infections can dampen sentiment around international travel during the holiday season. Amid rising HMPV infections in several countries, it is crucial to understand how travel insurance can help people navigate medical emergencies during their foreign trips. Travel insurance policies generally cover medical emergencies and treatments for sudden injuries and illnesses. People can get financial assistance even when they contract HMPV and other viral infections during their trip. “Our travel insurance policy covers medical emergencies and treatments related to unexpected illnesses or injuries, including flu and viruses like HMPV, while travelling abroad. This includes hospitalisation, surgical procedures, and emergency medical evacuations,” said Rakesh Jain, CEO of Reliance General Insurance. Jain noted that insurers must declare Pre-existing illnesses (if any) at the time of policy issuance to maximize travel insurance benefits. However, travel insurance policies and their coverage might vary and hence, travellers must carefully assess their policy before finalisation. Verifying whether they cover common illnesses and potential emergencies is important, said  Meet Kapadia, Head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar. Several insurance companies provide 24/7 assistance for customers. They can contact their insurance providers for help with hospital identification, treatment expenses in case of medical emergencies, and other services during their holiday trips. “Our policyholders can contact our 24/7 emergency assistance team for guidance and support. We will help facilitate medical treatment, including arranging hospital admissions, guaranteeing payments, and coordinating evacuations if necessary. It's crucial to keep all medical records and receipts, as these will be required to process claims more effectively per policy terms and conditions,” said Rakesh Jain. Purchasing a travel insurance policy through an aggregator might help people at the time of claim or availing its benefits. “Travelers can access cashless services at network hospitals by informing their insurer or Policybazaar. In emergencies where cashless options aren’t available, reimbursement claims can be processed with the required medical documentation,” said Meet Kapadia. “In addition to medical emergencies, comprehensive travel insurance plans also cover trip delays, baggage loss, medical evacuation, and other disruptions, ensuring that travellers are prepared for a wide range of contingencies,” Kapadia added.

Customers need to visit select PNB MetLife branches and wear the VR headset to get their service requirements addressed. Assisting them in this process would be an insurance expert based out of another location. The platform would display policy related information and engage customers through visual assist elements like animation, the company said.

It is the first-of-its-kind in the insurance sector, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) member (life) Nilesh Sathe said at an event in the city after IRDAI Chairman T.S. Vijayan launched the facility.

The conVRse platform would initially be available in 15 branches across 10 cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Jammu, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, and Pune. Noting that the company has been experimenting with the VR facility in Delhi for six months now, PNB MetLife managing director and CEO Tarun Chugh said the company would be extending the facility to all the 130 branches in phases and then eventually to customers homes.

Counting the advantages, Mr. Chugh said it would help customers be better informed about their policy and reduce misselling. He expected the facility to become popular as the price of the headsets is on the decline. From Rs. 33,000 a few years ago, the cost hovers around Rs. 7,500 a device, and was expected to come down further.

Mr. Vijayan said IRDAI was keen on customers getting the best service, irrespective of whether they were in rural or urban areas. The developments in technology, he said, should make it happen.

Insurance sector has been a bit slow in adopting technology, Mr. Sathe said. “Going forward, traditional insurance companies will find it difficult if they do not adopt technology.”

Later, to a query he replied that the growth in new business premium till November was 38 per cent and was expected to be 20 to 25 per cent by the end of the fiscal.

The consumer forum also ruled that rejecting the claim amounted to deficiency of service, and asked the company to pay a compensation of Rs. 50,000.

The order passed on June 9 was the result of a petition filed by Surekha Nallwar, a resident of Khairatabad, who approached the Forum after MetLife Insurance Company Limited rejected an insurance claim for a policy taken by her son N. Praveen Kumar, for which she was the only nominee.

The single premium policy was taken on October 31, 2008, for a sum of Rs. 22,025.

The said policy was taken to offset any outstanding payments on a housing loan amount of Rs. 16,72,025 taken by Mr. Kumar, and it covered his property and life.

The last EMI of Rs. 9,494 was paid by Mr. Kumar on January 7, 2009, on the loan. The next day, Mr. Kumar collapsed due to a seizure, after which he was rushed to Global Hospital at Lakdikapul.

After check-up and tests were done on Mr. Kumar, he was asked to come for a review to the hospital on January 22. However, he died on January 20 itself due to a ‘cardio respiratory arrest’.

After that, his mother, the complainant, approached the insurance company to claim the amount required for the loan on grounds of accidental death.

However, Ms. Nallwar’s request was rejected by the company, which stated that her son had died on the 82{+n}{+d}day after he took the policy, before completion of the 90-day waiting period.

In response to her complaint, MetLife Insurance Company Limited said that since Mr. Kumar’s death was caused due to a ‘cardio respiratory arrest’ and was not an accident.

It pointed out that the policy stated that during the waiting period, benefits will not be paid ‘on death to causes other than accident’.

After going through all the evidence at hand, the Forum however ruled that the company was at fault and liable to pay Ms. Nallwar the remaining amount of the housing loan, along with a compensation of Rs.50,000.

The ruling bench noted that “even on compassionate grounds the insurer ought to have not taken a technical objection for a mere 8 days short of the stipulated 90 days.”

Satwiksairaj.

In an informal chat at the unveiling of the trophy for the PNB-Metlife Trophy junior badminton championship to be held in Hyderabad in October, the champion doubles shuttler said the chances of a medal could be 50-50.

“It is never going to be easy. We cannot take anyone lightly. And, I don’t think numbers matter (being World No. 3 along with his partner Chirag Shetty),” he said.

“Consistency will be the key as we aim to do well in what is also the second Asian Games for us. We don’t want to think too much other than taking it match by match as always to avoid any sort of pressure,” Satwik said.

“The mantra for our success is that results have been excellent after we started spending more time together off the court. The chemistry is superb. We speak to each other in a very free and frank manner. There is nothing to talk behind each other. And, we know our job better,” he explained.

“In majors like the Commonwealth Games, and Worlds we play our hearts out and it will be no different in the coming Asiad. It is not that we don’t give 100 per cent in other tournaments. But, definitely there will be more than 100 in these championships,” Satwik said.

For his part, Chirag said that they won the Indonesian Open title after a couple of early round losses in the events preceding that major.

“So, I don’t think we are too concerned about our recent results,” he said.

“Right from the day our journey began as doubles players, we kept things simple. Treat both wins and losses on par. We will be neither really happy after a win nor extremely sad after a loss. Every day is a new day with fresh challenges,” Chirag said.

“Personally, it is a nice feeling to be World No. 3 but again as Satwik said, these things don’t matter though we would be definitely happy to be World No. 1,” he said.

Congratulations to #IndianOil's dynamic duo of @satwiksairaj and @Shettychirag04 for the spirited, gritty win at the #KoreanOpen2023! 🏆🏸 Boys, your winning streak has brought immense joy to us and the country. Your comeback proved that champions are undeterred by setbacks.… pic.twitter.com/zs0uae06ce

The duo, mentors at PNB Metlife, said they owed a lot to their parents and family members who never put any kind of pressure on them.

“In fact, my mother often tells me not to get disappointed after a loss as the parents of the other players could be praying for their sons’ success,” Chirag said with a big smile.

https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/taylor-swifts-fashion-tips/article7413746.ece,Taylor Swift’s fashion tips,12-Jul-15,"Singer Taylor Swift surprised a male fan on blogging website Tumblr by giving him style tips for his prom.

The fan posted a photograph of himself posing in two different looks and captioned the image saying: “So prom is on Thursday and I need to know, tie or bow tie?”

The                         Shake It Off         hit-maker then surprised the boy with her response and suggested that he wear the tie to look like a “modern movie star”.

“I like the tie, but honestly, both are great. I just feel like you look like a 50s movie star in the bow tie, but more like a modern movie star in the tie. Depends on what vibe you’re wanting to convey, but I’d say the tie. Great suit btw! (sic),” Swift replied.

And while Swift is happy to dish out style advice, she previously revealed she turns to friends Lena Dunham and Zooey Deschanel for inspiration when it comes to her own outfits.

“For fashion inspiration... Lena Dunham always has great websites and shops at great stores. She always tells me her newest obsession, whether it is a new website, a blog or a store; she’s really good with that stuff. And Zooey Deschanel is one of the most fashionable people I know,” she said.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/Tata-Sons-plans-to-sell-3-stake-in-TCS/article16919474.ece,Tata Sons plans to sell 3% stake in TCS,21-Dec-16,"Tata Sons plans to sell a three per cent stake in the country’s largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services, for Rs.14,700 crore and acquire a 70 per cent stake in PNB Metlife for Rs.2,700 crore.

It also plans to sell a 30 per cent stake in its renewable power venture for Rs.3,000 crore. These were decisions approved during the last few board meetings, according to the minutes of the Tata Sons meeting, which was filed as part of Mistry’s petition against Tata Sons.

Tata Sons FY17 business plan projected total income of Rs.8,103 crore and expenses of Rs.2,425 crore, resulting in an estimated profit of Rs.5,677 crore. The business plan included a proposal to sell 3 per cent in cash cow TCS for meeting a part of the fund requirements during the year. Profit of Rs.14,700 crore was estimated on the sale, according to the minutes of Tata Sons’ September board meeting. The board was however informed that the proposed sale of TCS stake was work in progress and could be spread over two years.

At the October 24 board meeting it was decided that Tata AIA Life Insurance Company Limited would be putting a non-binding bid to acquire a 70 per cent stake in PNB Metlife for Rs.2,700 crore. Met holds 26 per cent stake in PNB Metlife, 21 per cent stake is being held by Elpro, 18 per cent by M Paloonji & Company and 5 per cent by Jammu & Kashmir Bank Limited and the rest by Punjab National Bank.

Mr. Ishaat Hussain proposed a deal structure under which Tata along with AIA would buy out the existing stake of all stake holders in PNB Metife, aggregating to 70 per cent, other than that of Punjab National Bank, followed by a merger of the two insurers.

The initial outgo from Tata Sons would be in the range of Rs.1,500 crore to Rs.2,700 crore with Tata Sons holdings in Tata AIA Life Insurance Company expected to be diluted from 51 per cent to 45 per cent post the deal.

Vodafone proposal

In the June board meeting of Tata Sons, Nitin Nohria reported on his discussions with the CEO of Vodafone, who continued to be interested in acquiring Tata Teleservives Limited (TTSL).

Dr. Nohria mentioned that the start of Reliance Jio was expected to impact the existing telecom players including Vodafone. He explained that Vodafone would be serious about consolidation in order to make up for the losses of customers to Jio.

Renewable power

In a presentation on Tata Power before a board meeting in June, when Tata bought the assets of Welspun Renewables Energy for Rs. 10,000 crore, Anil Sardana, MD & CEO Tata Power informed the board that the acquisition was proposed to be initially funded by borrowing of Rs.3,500 crore for investment into Tata Power Renewable Energy and another Rs.500 crore at the holding company level.

“Within a year, a 30 per cent dilution TPREL was envisaged by the TPC management to raise Rs.3,000 to Rs.3,600 crore to repay a significant portion of the acquisition debt,” Mr. Sardana said, citing investors who had spoken of a 8-9 per cent multiple on renewable investments compared with 6 per cent for Tata Power.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/2026-fifa-world-cup-final-to-be-played-in-new-jersey/article67812889.ece,2026 FIFA World Cup final to be played in New Jersey,05-Feb-24,"The 2026 World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, U.S., on July 19.

FIFA made the announcement Sunday at a Miami television studio, allocating the opener of the 39-day tournament spread across three North American nations to Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca on June 11 and the finale to the home of the NFL's New York Jets and Giants.

“It will be a celebration of our diversity and our values,” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said in a telephone interview. “The bigger picture is what leads up to it and what we leave behind for the decades to come.”

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had lobbied for the final to be at his AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

“The competition was dealing with the perception of the coastal, of a New York, or a Los Angeles,” he said. “If this were totally being played to just America and the United States, that wouldn’t have been such a formidable thing to overcome. But internationally, that’s formidable to overcome.”

All games from the quarterfinals on are in the United States. Semifinals are on July 14 at AT&T Stadium and the following day at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

Quarterfinals are at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 9, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the following day, and at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 11. The third-place game will be at Hard Rock on July 18.

The U.S. team will train in suburban Atlanta ahead of the tournament and open at SoFi on June 12. The Americans play seven days later at Seattle’s Lumen Field and finish the group stage at SoFi on June 25.

Since reaching the semifinals of the first World Cup in 1930, the U.S. has advanced to the quarterfinals just once, in 2002.

Seventy-eight of 104 matches of the first World Cup held in three nations will be played in the U.S., with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada.

“It’s about making our nation proud,” American coach Gregg Berhalter said. “One way to really grow the game and to change football in America forever is to perform well and do something that no U.S. team has ever done before.”

AT&T, which had hopes to present the final, will host a tournament-high nine matches. There will be eight each at MetLife, SoFi and Mercedes Benz; seven apiece at Hard Rock, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and NRG Stadium in Houston; and six apiece at Lumen, Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

FIFA officials did not publicly explain their site-decision process.

Philadelphia’s final match will be a round-of-16 meeting on July 4, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park hosts baseball's All-Star Game, likely on July 14.

Santa Clara is the only U.S. site that will not host a game after the new round of 32.

FIFA expanded the World Cup from 32 to 48 nations, increased matches from 64 and announced the 16 sites in 2022.

Murphy learned of the decision while at a watch party in a MetLife Stadium suite. He was not discouraged by a British tabloid report on Jan. 17 that the final would be at AT&T.

“We did everything we could to put our head downs, focus on the job at hand, kind of push out the noise, and that turned out to be a winning formula,” Murphy said,

Mexico will play its second match at Estadio BBVA in Monterrey on June 18 and return to Azteca on June 24. Mexico City will host five matches, with four each in Monterrey and Guadalajara's Estadio Akron.

Canada will play its opening first-round match in Toronto on June 12, then its following two games in B.C. Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 18 and 24. Each Canada venue will host 13 games.

A nation will need to play eight matches to win the title, up from seven since 1982.

All 11 of the U.S. stadiums are home to NFL teams. Hard Rock will host this year’s Copa América final on July 14, while MetLife was the site of the 2016 Copa América final.

Both the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals were at Azteca.

When the U.S. hosted the 24-nation, 52-game tournament in 1994, the final was at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the opener at Chicago’s Soldier Field and the semifinals at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford and the Rose Bowl.

With the additional teams, the length of the tournament will grow from 29 days in the shortened 2022 schedule in Qatar and 32 days for the 2018 tournament in Russia.

Only one match will involve a team that has not had at least three off days. FIFA divided the group stage into East, Central and West regions and intended to make travel shorter for group winners.

The stadiums in Arlington, Atlanta and Houston have retractable roofs that are expected to be closed because of summer heat, and Inglewood and Vancouver have fixed roofs.

Artificial turf will be replaced by grass in Arlington, Atlanta, East Rutherford, Foxborough, Houston, Inglewood and Vancouver.

Several of the venues are expected to widen their surfaces to accommodate a 75-by-115 yard (68-by-105 meter) playing field, including AT&T and MetLife.

FIFA did not announce kickoff times. The 1994 championship started at 12:30 p.m. PDT (3:30 p.m. EDT and 9:30 p.m. in Central Europe) but the start has been moved up in recent years as Asia’s television market become more significant to FIFA. The 2022 final in Qatar started at 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. EDT, 4 p.m. in Central Europe and 10 p.m. in Beijing).

Anmol had defeated Ravi Uttej Ayyagari Phani 15-7, 15-10 in the penultimate round in a qualifying draw of 256 in the boys’ under-13 event, and is set to meet Vivek Bansal in the final qualifying round.

While the top seeds in the other events, Shivani Nibadiya (u-13 girls), Rahul Kane (u-15 boys) and Lakshmi Priyanka (u-15 girls) failed to make it, it was a gigantic task for the organisers to go through hundreds of matches in the boys and girls sections in the two age groups, in singles and doubles, within three days.

The entries were overwhelming with 239 (u-13 boys), 150 (u-13 girls), 401 (u-15 boys) and 287 (u-15 girls) in the four sections. The main draw featuring 64 players in the u-13 boys section, and 32 players in the other three singles events, will be played from Thursday to Saturday. The tournament, offering a total scholarship fund of Rs. 300,000, has already proved to be a “'round the clock” badminton festival for the players and their parents. — Special Correspondent

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/best-performance-of-my-career/article61795461.ece,‘Best performance of my career’ - Sai Praneeth,16-Apr-17,"“This is the best performance of my career,” said B. Sai Praneeth shortly after winning the $350, 000 MetLife BWF Super Series-OUE Singapore Open men’s singles title at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sunday.

“There is nothing like winning the crown,” he told                         The Hindu        , even when compared to his defeats of badminton heavyweights Lee Chong Wei and Taufiq Hidayat.

“I dedicate this win to my family, Gopi Sir (chief National coach Pullela Gopichand), coaches and support staff at the academy,” he said referring to the institution in Hyderabad where he trains.

Retracing his steps to the title, the men’s singles world No. 30 said: “After losing the first game, I equalised at seven, 11 and 12. When I got ahead by two points, I got confidence to pull off the victory. I found my rhythm and thereon the going was good,” said the Human Resources Executive with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), posted to Chennai but who trains in his hometown Hyderabad through most of the year.

Did he regret having to defeat his academy-mate and compatriot Kidambi Srikanth 17-21, 21-17, 21-12 for the title ? “I felt a little bad about playing a fellow-Indian in the final. Srikanth also has big victories in his career and he deserved to be in the final,” said Sai, a B. Com. graduate from St. Joseph’s College, Himayathnagar in Hyderabad, while paying tribute to his opponent in the final.

What’s Praneeth like outside badminton? “I have no memorable achievement outside the sport. I enjoy movies and hanging out with friends,” added the 24-year-old, who won the Canadian Open Grand Prix last year and made the final of the Syed Modi Grand Prix this year.

Rahman's journey in cinema. And nothing could dampen the spirit tonight. Not even the incessant rains that conspired since morning. Though they were intermittent rains, they too gave themselves a breather post 10 p.m. just to allow the maestro enthrall the audience.

The host for the night Manish Paul and Riteish Deshmukh had the audience in splits with their one liners. The show started with Kamal Khan singing all the Chartbusters and also had the audience grooving to many of the Salman Khan numbers.

Joining him on stage were the very talented Jonita Gandhi, Neeti Mohan, Javed Ali, Benny Dayal and Haricharan.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-poised-to-attract-more-bfsi-facilities/article68385689.ece,Hyderabad poised to attract more BFSI facilities,09-Jul-24,"Hyderabad is poised to consolidate its position as a preferred destination for facilities of Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) firms on the back of its strategic location as well as government’s commitment to foster a thriving business environment.

The city is likely to attract more major BFSI players in the coming quarters thus strengthening its position as a comprehensive business destination catering to diverse industries, government sources said, citing as examples the decision of Cigna Healthcare, Lloyds Bank, Swiss Re, MetLife, DTCC and Ameriprise.

While Hyderabad has emerged as a prominent IT hub, the first half of 2024 (January-June) saw several BFSI organisations establishing presence signifying a significant shift contributing to Hyderabad’s position as a well-rounded business hub. The developments reflect the growing confidence in the city’s robust infrastructure, skilled workforce, overall business environment and a stable political environment.

The office leasing activity is an indicator of growing engagement of BFSI in Hyderabad with the sector H1-2024 accounting for as much one third of office space offtake. It also highlights the supportive, robust ecosystem Hyderabad fosters and benefits not just large corporations but also for startups within the BFSI sector.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Messi-targets-Copa-Centenario-cup/article14378269.ece?src=ilaw,Messi targets Copa Centenario cup,01-Jun-16,"Lionel Messi and Argentina will be targeting the country’s 23-year title drought when the Copa America Centenario kicks off on Friday after a troubled build-up marred by corruption allegations which threatened to derail the event.

One hundred years after Uruguay clinched the inaugural four-team South American championship in Argentina, 16 teams from across the Americas are gathered in the United States for a special one-off edition of the tournament.

The three-week festival of football gets under way at the Levi's Stadium in California on Friday, when the United States face Colombia at the home of the San Francisco 49ers American football team.

The tournament will conclude with a final at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on June 26, drawing a line under what is arguably the biggest tournament held in the United States since the 1994 World Cup.

Billed as a celebration of football across the Americas, 10 South American teams and six teams from the CONCACAF (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) region make up the field.

For organizers, the mere fact that the tournament is taking place at all is something of a triumph.

For several months last year the Copa faced an uncertain future after the arrest and indictment for corruption of several officials from South America and CONCACAF responsible for dreaming up the tournament.

'World Cup of Fraud':         When plans for the tournament were launched at a glitzy event in Miami in 2014, CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb stood proudly alongside South American federation (CONMEBOL) chief Eugenio Figueredo.

“The American continent may have been discovered in 1492, but I can't imagine a better way to unite this continent than with football,” Webb said.

Yet if prosecutors have their way, both men may soon be united behind bars.

Webb and Figueredo were among several officials arrested in Switzerland in May 2015 as part of the US-led corruption investigation which ultimately led to the sensational downfall of FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

With impeccable timing, Webb is due to appear in a New York courtroom on Friday — the day of the opening match — to face sentencing for his role in the scandal.

Figueredo, 84, was extradited to Uruguay from Switzerland last December and also faces criminal prosecution.

Both Figueredo and Webb — as well as former CONMEBOL chief Nicolas Leoz — are accused of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes linked to the award of media rights for the tournament, part of a scam dubbed a ""World Cup of Fraud"".

'We deserve championship'        : The sleazy background to the competition threatened to take the shine off an event which will bring together some of the world's best players.

Messi and Argentina will be aiming to win the country's first major title since the 1993 Copa America after a series of recent near-misses.

The Argentines lost both the 2014 World Cup final and the 2015 Copa America in Chile. Messi, due in Spain this week to attend his trial for tax fraud, says it is time Argentina's talented players delivered.

“It has been a very long time since Argentina has won anything, and this group came very close in the World Cup and at the last Copa America,” he told Sports Illustrated on the eve of the tournament.

“I think we deserve to be champions of an important competition.”

Argentina opens their campaign against Chile in Santa Clara next Monday. Panama and Bolivia complete Group D.

The United States meanwhile will aim to build on their encouraging performance at the 2014 World Cup, when they reached the knockout round, by progressing from a ""Group of Death"" which includes Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay.

Five-time World Cup winners Brazil will be favoured to safely navigate Group B, where they face Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.

The Brazilians open against Ecuador at Pasadena's Rose Bowl on Saturday — scene of their victory at the 1994 World Cup final.

Mexico and Uruguay will be expected to progress from Group C, with Jamaica and Venezuela completing the field.                         © AFP, 2016

A motley crew of 18 die-hard fans, drawn from a string of contests on social media conducted by STAR Sports shadowed Saina Nehwal in the MetLife BWF World superseries. Outfitted with dark blue personalised jerseys, travel T-shirts with names, caps, badges and friendship bands, the ‘Saina Squad’ was visibly and vocally supportive of the Indian ace.

Out of the rooting Carolina Marin got during the BWF finals from a set of Spanish fans, all the more pronounced in the finals when Indonesian fans supported the world No. 1, was born the STAR Sports concept of a dedicated band of followers for Saina. Saina was excited for this was something she had never done before, said a STAR Sports marketing team member. A meet and greet programme was held on the eve of the championship, where the ‘Saina Squad’, flown in from India, met its favourite sportsperson.

The world No. 2’s first round defeat to Nozomi Okuhara was more than made up for by a fighting win over world champion Carolina Marin. “We’ll continue to back you,” the squad had told Saina after that first setback against the Japanese shuttler.

The ‘Saina Squad’ was a mix of fans from across the country, ranging in age from 18 to 43 years. On Thursday night after the Indian ace’s victory over Marin, the squad was understandably elated. Before she left the stadium, Saina spent time with her fans, who shot selfies with her.

Meanwhile, Viktor Axelsen pulled off the biggest upset of the MetLife BWF World Superseries, toppling two-time world champion Chen Long 21-12, 21-17on Saturday. In the women’s semifinals, Nozomi Okuhara stunned the world champion 21-11, 21-12.

The results: (Semifinals): Men:         Viktor Axelson (Den) bt Chen Long (Chi) 21-12, 21-17; Kento Momoto (Jap) bt Jan O Jorgensen (Den) 21-19, 21-18.

Women:         Nozomi Okuhara (Jap) bt Carolina Marin (Spa) 21-11, 21-12; Wang Yihan (Chi) bt Ratchanok Intanon (Tha) 21-12, 21-12.

LIC has eased the procedure for settlement of claims on the lives of flood victims who are policyholders, the insurer said in a statement.

“These concessions and relaxations are in the nature of simplified procedure for death and disability claim settlement, loss of policy document claim settlement on the lives of ‘missing’ persons etc, similar to the concessions extended to the victims of floods and landslides in Uttarakhand in June 2013, flood disaster in J&K in September 2014, Cyclone in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha in October 2014 and Nepal disaster in April 2015,” it said.

The recent floods in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have caused injury and loss of lives on a big scale.

In a separate statement, PNB MetLife said it has set up a dedicated claims helpline for the Tamil Nadu flood victims with Toll free number                         18004256969         in an effort to provide relief and assistance to the victims.

PNB MetLife has streamlined the claim process for the aid of flood-affected customers where easy alternatives to the standard documents can be submitted.

Over 40,000 people cheered for their favourite Bollywood stars as they walked the IIFA Green Carpet ahead of the awards ceremony at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The hosts for the evening, Karan Johar and Saif Ali Khan, kept the audience in splits with great repartee and witty conversations with fellow Bollywood celebrities.

Alia Bhatt’s debut in IIFA saw her performing to a medley of hit songs from her movies. Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon wooed the audience with their crackling chemistry as they jived to retro tracks.

Katrina Kaif caused a storm on stage with her pulsating performance and Salman Khan danced away to songs from                         Tubelight        .

https://www.thehindu.com/business/ulips-may-attract-more-investors-in-2018/article22271475.ece,‘ULIPs may attract more investors in 2018’,24-Dec-17,"Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has recorded 89% growth in new business premium in its unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs), riding on the boom in the equity markets. ULIPs would be an attractive investment option for retail investors in 2018, says                           Tarun Chugh          , the firm’s CEO and MD, in an interview. Edited excerpts:

What is the outlook for insurance industry in FY18?

The major trend in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) space is the uptake in the equity markets, especially from retail investors. We have seen 89% growth in new business premium of our Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) from April to September 2017. We also expect this trend to continue in the new year as equity markets are looking up. [We are] planning to launch more ULIP products in the months to come.

What are the three top trends in digitisation of insurance that you have seen in the last three years?

Insurers have realised the value of digitisation in insurance.

It leads to enhancement of customer experience, creates new business opportunities, helps in reducing costs, allows operational flexibility and drives engagement with customers on a real-time basis. The top three trends, addressing these business opportunities, would be: end-to-end paperless processes from presales to underwriting to post-sales services; growth in online sales; providing services which are quick, non-intrusive and available 24x7

Rapidly changing consumer behaviour is reshaping the insurance industry. How will digitisation impact customers?

Consumer behaviour has been reshaped with the advent of digital and e-commerce companies in the last two decades. This gamut of digitisation, brought in by these companies, is continuously evolving. Its impact can be seen in the way consumers, both new and traditional, are engaging with businesses. Consumers today have greater access to real time information. Hence, it is vital that organisations acknowledge this shift in consumer behaviour.

This change is challenging insurers, who are not digitally native, to focus on products, business models and service delivery models which are end-to-end digital. This will result in better offerings in the form of improvised offerings, reduced TATs (turn around time) and personalised experiences.

We are continuously investing in improving our offerings on the digital platforms, both through our own website and via web aggregators. Contribution of online sales to our entire portfolio has been increasing rapidly.

We are also embracing digitisation to stay in tune with the expectations of the end consumer and making our processes paperless. A customer today can have his proposal form digitally filled on a tab, complete his E-KYC via Aadhaar verification and have his policy document delivered electronically via mail and stored in IRDAI authorised e-repositories such as CAMS, KARVY and NSDL.

How has the agent-company relationship evolved?

At Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, agency continues to be the key distribution channel with nearly 86% of the retail-rated new business premium being routed through this channel. Nearly 77% of the company’s total customers are mass and sub-mass segments. Their ability to buy high premium products, multiple policies and risk-taking capacity was limited. Thus, this year, we focused on improving our product mix to cater to affluent and mass affluent segments.

In September, we introduced I-smart, a comprehensive portal for our agents. I-smart is available on mobile and tablet devices, and has already seen 12,500 downloads with 5,000 agents using it on a daily basis and 500 fresh downloads every day.

Today, mobile should be considered as the consumer’s remote control to start engagement with brand. From real-time executions to native campaigns, location-based targeting and advertising, mobile’s power is that it’s personal; all-pervasive – it’s with the consumers all day, from first thing in the morning till the last thing at night; and useful – it is consumed on the go. In other words, Mobile-based touchpoints will be the face for not only the life insurance sector, but also across BFSI space as mobile-based touchpoints can reduce complexities in underwriting, distribution and product servicing, and increase customer engagement on real time basis.

How do you ensure data security?

Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has implemented Data loss prevention (DLP) solution which protects sensitive information going outside company network via Mail, USB or Network. We have [also] implemented Mobile Device Management (MDM) for all mobile devices accessing company mails. This prevents users from downloading any attachment to mobile devices. All company-related information can be wiped out in case a device is lost.

In tier 2 / 3 markets, we have extensively used analytics to understand the customer needs better and thereafter provide the right product. We have worked on our product portfolio and have the right mix of product offerings across both Traditional and ULIP categories that suit customer needs. We are one of the largest players in the Tier 2 / 3 markets and are looking at further enhancing our presence by recruiting an additional 10,000 agents by the end of this fiscal. We have also intensified our insurance awareness drives by conducting roadshows and                         nukkad nataks         which educate consumers about the importance of being insured and to existing customers with policy renewal at their doorstep.

Why are so many insurance companies going in for IPOs?

IRDA’s (Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority) move to relax capital raising norms whereby it allowed insurance companies [in existence for] over 10 years to go public, has led to a slew of IPOs.

Listing on the stock market has been principally taken by companies to raise capital for expansion of operations, increase liquidity for shareholders, enhance brand image and create valuable currency stocks that can be used to make acquisitions and compensate employees.

It is likely these IPOs will bring about better awareness regarding insurance services among the investing public. That may translate into an increase in insurance penetration (percentage of insurance premia to GDP), better products and enhanced service standards.

Does Bajaj Allianz Life also have plans for an IPO?

No, we are not looking at an IPO [any time] soon.

“It has been a very long time since Argentina has won anything, and this group came very close in the World Cup and at the last Copa America,” he told Sports Illustrated on the eve of the tournament.

“I think we deserve to be champions of an important competition.”

Argentina opens their campaign against Chile in Santa Clara next Monday. Panama and Bolivia complete Group D.

The United States meanwhile will aim to build on their encouraging performance at the 2014 World Cup, when they reached the knockout round, by progressing from a ""Group of Death"" which includes Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay.

Five-time World Cup winners Brazil will be favoured to safely navigate Group B, where they face Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.

The Brazilians open against Ecuador at Pasadena's Rose Bowl on Saturday — scene of their victory at the 1994 World Cup final.

Mexico and Uruguay will be expected to progress from Group C, with Jamaica and Venezuela completing the field.                         © AFP, 2016

https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/diplodocus-again/article19819865.ece,"Diplodocus, again",08-Oct-17,"With its walnut-sized brain mounted atop a 26-foot-long telescopic neck, the Diplodocus failed to grasp the the implications of the orange-red shooting star, which was becoming brighter by the hour. He continued to relish the tasty tree-top vegetation, beating his shorter but more vicious competitors. That was 65 million years ago.

On July 12, 2017, sitting in the comfy living room in our southern Indian home, my attention was focussed on the TV show, live broadcast of the IIFA (Indian International Film Academy) Award function, held at the ‘brim-filled’ Metlife stadium at New York, with the Bollywood glitterati dancing and prancing about, on a high-voltage digital stage.

Meanwhile, an event

I too failed to grasp the implications of an unusual ecological event happening silently on the same day. Some 9,500 miles south of New York, on the northwestern coast of icy Antarctica, the final separation of the ‘Larsen C’ ice shelf was under way.

I tried search ‘the greatest rift on earth’ and ended up reading one that began behind closed doors in a  Beverly Hills home in Los Angeles, and ended in a private courtroom, where Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie separated, upsetting thousands of their fans.

In contrast, the MIDAS site representing the U.K.-based Antarctic Research project, tracking the developing rift in Antarctica, had few visitors; ‘Larsen C’ perhaps did not authorise them to use click-bait.

Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, was sailing along the icy coast of Antarctica in December 1893.

The ice-shelf

Larsen quickly realised that the shoreline he was looking at was not a real one but a shelf of ice protruding out, like a balcony. The only difference was that the natural icy projection was a billion times larger than a balcony. Extending hundreds of miles  and thousands of square miles in area, the shelf was aptly named the ‘Larsen shelf’. They are designated A to E based on location.

The Aqua satellite, armed with MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer), primarily used to locate and assess water bodies, was the first to pick up a developing crack, a kind of mile-long fault line, in the ice-shelf of Larsen C.

Starting late-2014, scientists of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) working with satellite data tracking the rift found that the defect in the Larsen C was growing steadily. By 2016 the crack became 70 miles long and 300 feet wide. By January 2017 it measured 109 miles in length and 1,500 metres in breadth.

On July 12, it broke. The broken shelf, now an official iceberg, was massive, indeed the biggest-ever such iceberg, weighing 1.1 trillion tons and measuring 2,200 square miles.

The consequence

What is the consequence of this rift? The detachment of more than one trillion tons of ice shelf, floating out in the open sea, and eventually melting, is expected to result in, well, just nothing. Ocean levels all over the world will not even rise by 1 cm. It’s no doomsday.

The extinction of Dodo, the loss of hundreds of hectares of rainforest every year, the Royal Bengal Tiger population inching towards zero — none of this brought humanity close to doomsday. We will still enjoy our cup of hot coffee, drive to office and do our work.

The ‘Larsen C’ rift indicates the beginning of a major ecological shift, though. Despite our highly evolved ‘100-billion-neuron’ brain, we have decided to ignore it and munch on our burgers.

Just like the Diplodocus.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/companies/higher-provisioning-hits-pnb-net/article2302603.ece,Higher provisioning hits PNB net,29-Jul-11,"The higher provision for bad debts and decline in treasury income had its impact on the revenue of Punjab National Bank (PNB) which posted a marginal 3.4 per cent rise in net profit at Rs.1,105 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2011, against Rs.1,068 crore in the year-ago period. Total income, however, grew by 37 per cent to Rs.9,399 crore from Rs.6,863 crore.

“The net profit has been impacted due to higher provisioning, decline in treasury income during the quarter,” Chairman and Managing Director K. R. Kamath told reporters here.

However, the operating profit rose by 18 per cent to Rs.2,474 crore from Rs.2,098 crore. The bank made a total provision of Rs.1,368 crore. Of this, Rs.566 crore was towards bad debts and Rs.475 crore for income tax. Net interest income grew by 20 per cent to Rs.3,155 crore. “There is upward bias on the rates. The bank will decide on the hike on Friday,” he said.

The bank had decided to join hands with MetLife India for a proposed entry into the life insurance segment. “We have considered offers made by various companies and selected MetLife India as our partner,” Mr. Kamath said.

During the year, the bank's net interest margin declined to 3.84 per cent from 3.91 per cent at the end of June, 2010. Capital adequacy of the bank as at the end of June as per the Basel-II norms was 12.42 per cent at the end of June, 2011.

Significantly, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a proportion of advances went up to 2 per cent from 1.82 per cent. Net NPAs also rose to 0.86 per cent from 0.66 per cent. Asserting that gross NPA level was not alarming, Mr. Kamath said the bank had put focus on recovery.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Chile-stun-Argentina-to-lift-Copa-America-title/article60562664.ece,Chile stun Argentina to lift Copa America title,27-Jun-16,"Holders Chile stunned Argentina to win the Copa America Centenario in a penalty shootout on Sunday as Lionel Messi's title curse struck again.

Messi blazed a penalty over the bar in the shoot-out before Lucas Biglia missed to leave Chile's Francisco Silva with the task of stroking home the winning spot-kick at the MetLife Stadium.

It was a carbon copy of last year's Copa America final, also won by Chile on penalties after a goalless draw.

Argentina's players meanwhile were left disconsolate as they digested a third defeat in a major final following losses to Germany in the 2014 World Cup and Chile in last year's Copa.

The defeat also ensured Argentina's 23-year wait for a major title — and a first for five-time world player of the year Messi — continued.

The final had gone to penalties after finishing deadlocked at 0-0 after 120 minutes.

Both sides were reduced to 10 men in the first half as Brazilian referee Heber Lopes struggled to get a grip on an ill-tempered contest played in front of a crowd of 82,026.

The first yellow card of the match came in the 16th minute when Marcelo Diaz brought down Messi with a cynical hack across the thighs as the Barcelona star advanced on the Chilean goal.

Argentina should have taken the lead on 21 minutes when a defensive blunder from Gary Medel, miscontrolling a back pass, allowed Gonzalo Higuain to go clean through on goal.

Chile let-off

Higuain had time and space but opted to lift his shot over the advancing Bravo and it rolled wide of the post in a huge let-off for Chile.

It was a nightmarish case of deja vu for Higuain, who missed potentially match winning chances in both the 2014 World Cup final and last year's Copa America.

Seven minutes later Chile were left rocking when Messi burst forward only to be bodychecked blatantly by Diaz.

For a moment it appeared that referee Lopes had forgotten Diaz's earlier caution but eventually he brandished a red card and Chile were down to 10.

It ought to have been a warning to both sides but the spiteful tone continued for the remainder of the half, with Javier Mascherano and Arturo Vidal next into the book in the 37th minute.

The next flare-up came on 40 minutes when Messi darted into the box at high speed and tumbled over following a collision with Jose Pedro Fuenzalida.

Chile's players surrounded Lopes demanding a yellow card for a dive and Messi was duly booked even though it looked for all the world as if he had simply gone down after being caught off balance.

Two minutes from half-time and Lopes was reaching for a red card, this time sending off Manchester United's Marcos Rojo for a rough tackle on Vidal.

The cards continued in a fractious start to the second half, Jean Beausejour booked for hacking at Gabriel Mercado.

A cynical foul on Messi by Charles Aranguiz resulted in another yellow card.

The introduction of Sergio Aguero for Higuain had little effect with Argentina failing to break the stalemate.

Chile striker Eduardo Vargas went close on the 80th minute, thumping a fierce low shot that Romero did well to block at his near post.

Aguero had a chance to steal victory in the 84th minute when he was worked into space on the right of the box but he blazed his shot high and wide.

There was still time for late drama when Ramiro Funes-Mori made a stunning match-saving block to deny Alexis Sanchez.

From the Argentinian counter-attack, Messi surged forward from halfway to shoot wide.

Amid suffocating tension in extra-time, Chile had the best early chance to score in the 98th minute when he headed Edson Puch's cross only to be denied by Romero.

Aguero then drew a fine save from Bravo with a looping header.

After that there was little in the way of chances, leaving the game to hinge on the penalty shootout.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ill-be-marked-now-need-to-find-new-strategy-every-time-says-sindhu/article29384735.ece,"I’ll be marked now, need to find new strategy every time, says Sindhu",10-Sep-19,"Indian badminton ace P V Sindhu says she will be marked by opponents after her World Championships gold and would need to constantly discover “new things” in her game to maintain her stranglehold on international badminton.

Olympic silver medallist Sindhu became the first Indian to win a historic World Championships gold medal after thrashing Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 in a lop-sided final at Basel, Switzerland last month.

Asked about the challenges that she will face from now on, Sindhu, who boasts of two silver and as many bronze in the World Championships, said: “Pressure and responsibility will now be more. I know everybody will mark me now after the World Championship.

“Now I have to really work harder and change a few things and come with new things because everyone can see my game and know what I am playing. So I have to go with new strategy every time I go into the court,” Sindhu told reporters in New Delhi.

The 24-year-old from Hyderabad said the World Championships gold medal took a long time coming and it was a result of hard work, besides all the sacrifices that her parents have made over the years.

“I have been wanting this gold for five years. I have been losing every time. I also used to feel sad, but I always kept fighting back and working hard. My parents made a lot of sacrifices for me,” she said.

“Coaches role also has been important. My first coach was Mehboob Ali and then I have been under Gopi sir since I was 10. In badminton, you need to have a strong mindset.”

Sindhu will next play at the China Open World Tour Super 1000 (September 17-22) and Korea Open World Tour Super 500 (September 24-29) at Changzhou and Incheon City respectively.

“I am preparing for China and Korea Open, I will be leaving in a few days, that is my immediate goal. I hope to give my best,” she said on the sidelines of the PNB MetLife Junior Badminton Championship (JBC).

“This (gold) medal gave a big boost and I will move with this confidence. There are many events before Olympics, so I will just give 100 percent instead of taking pressure.”

Asked if there was any pressure ahead of the World Championships final, Sindhu said: “There was no pressure in the final. The quarterfinals was one of the good matches against Tai Tzu.

“Playing Okuhara, everyone was saying whether I will repeat the 2017 final but for me I was not thinking about that. It was a fresh match for me. We knew each others’ game, as we have played a lot against each other. So there was no particular strategy.”

National coach Pullela Gopichand had recently said that India have not “invested enough in coaches”.

Asked about her opinion on this issue, Sindhu said: “There needs to be high level coaches, where they need to know everything about badminton to create a champion.

“Of course, Gopi sir himself has been a great player and a great coach. Now we have other coaches from abroad and they are helping us. But national coaches need to be much qualified, then definitely they can train more players and they will become champions.”

Talking about the role of foreign coach Kim Ji Hyun of Korea, Sindhu said: “For last couple of months, I have been training with Kim under the guidance of Gopi sir. It is not just one stroke, each stroke is important, we have to make each stroke perfect.

“We have been working on defence and front and back court and that really helped me.”

Sindhu, who felicitated the winners of PNB MetLife Junior Badminton Championship (JBC), also gave a big thumbs-up to the tournament which completed its fifth edition here on Tuesday.

“It is a great idea and it is encouraging players of grassroot level. The number of participants is increasing and talent is there and we need to have tournaments like this for them to grow,” she said.

“PNB Metlife is encouraging and supporting each of them.”

https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-to-lead-task-force-preparing-for-2026-world-cup/article69305600.ece,Trump to lead task force preparing for 2026 World Cup,08-Mar-25,"President Donald Trump created a task force Friday (March 7, 2025) to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which will bring the globe's premier football tournament to North America at a time when his on-again, off-again tariffs have ratcheted up tensions across the continent.

“I think it's going to make it more exciting,” Mr. Trump said of playing the World Cup amid sharp rhetoric between leaders of the host nations. “Tension's a good thing.”

The task force, which Mr. Trump will chair, will coordinate the federal government's security and planning for the tournament, which is expected to draw millions of tourists to the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“It's a great honour for our country to have it,” Mr. Trump said of the World Cup after meeting with officials from FIFA, the international football governing body. He said he'd like to attend multiple games.

Preparations are ramping up across the continent alongside tensions between the United States and its neighbours as Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs before backing off, spooking markets and leading to fears of a trade war and economic downturn. He also speaks pejoratively of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and muses about Canada becoming a US state, which has boosted national pride north of the border.

For 2026, the World Cup will expand to 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations, the first time the tournament will be split between countries. Seventy-eight of 104 matches will be played in the US, with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada, and as many as six matches a day. The final will be played July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the task force will ensure that each of the visitors who will travel from around the world “feels safe, feels happy and feels that we are doing something special.”

“So we're here to create and to make the best show on the planet ever,” Mr. Infantino said. He gave Mr. Trump a personalised game ball and unveiled an elaborate trophy that will go to the winner of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, which will pit top football clubs against each other this summer ahead of next year's matchup of national teams.

Mr. Trump later brought Infantino to show off the trophy at the start of a White House cryptocurrency summit. The United States, where football has grown in popularity but remains a niche sport, represents a major growth area for football, he said.

Mr. Infantino likened producing the World Cup to holding three Super Bowls daily for a month, a dizzying security and logistical challenge for the host governments.

The Trump administration will face a second test on the global sports stage in 2028, when the summer Olympics will be held in California, the first time the Games will have been in the US since Salt Lake City hosted in 2002.

SEBI had, on Friday, banned 14 life insurance companies from selling ULIPs on the ground that they were akin to mutual funds and were launched without obtaining registration from it.

The insurance companies are likely to meet the Life Insurance Council on Monday to examine the various options including legal to counter the SEBI order.

The market regulator has banned 14 insurers — ICICI Prudential Life, Bharti AXA Life, Reliance Life, Aviva Life Bajaj Allianz Life, Birla Sun Life, Metlife Insurance, Tata AIG Life, Aegon Religare, HDFC Standard, Kotak Life, Max New York Life, ING Vyasa Life and SBI Life, from selling ULIPs. There is also speculation that SEBI would issue show casue notices to LIC and a few other life insurers for not seeking its approval before launching their ULIPs. SEBI has ordered all the 14 companies not to issue any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money by way of new and/or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from it.

SEBI had issued notices to these life insurers on January 15 except HDFC Standard Life, which was issued notice in December last, asking why they had not obtained permission from it before launching ULIPs. SEBI's contention is that ULIPs offered by the life insurers are a combination of investment and insurance and, therefore, the investment component is in the nature of mutual funds which can only be offered or launched after obtaining registration from SEBI.

Life insurers said that they have not yet received the SEBI order. Reacting to the SEBI's notice, insurance sector regulator, IRDA, said that ULIPs offered by different insurance companies are safe and secure and “the matter arising out of the recent orders of the SEBI would be addressed expeditiously in an appropriate forum in accordance with law.”

The figure is significantly more than the prize money offered for either the last men's or women's World Cups.

World football's governing body has given few details about the funding of the first edition of the 32-team tournament that will take place every four years but it has signed up a broadcaster and major sponsors in recent weeks.

British streaming service DAZN was awarded the exclusive global rights to the June 14-July 13 tournament in December with a source close to the negotiations saying the contract was worth around one billion euros ($1.05 billion).

FIFA has also signed sponsorship contracts with Coca-Cola, Bank of America, Chinese electronics brand Hisense and Belgian brewers AB InBev.

By comparison the total prize money for the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar was $440 million, while for the 2023 Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia it was $110 million.

This season's UEFA Champions League, with a new 36-club format, will pay a total 2.47 billion euros ($2.66 billion) to the clubs involved.

FIFA's expansion of the tournament has been met by widespread criticism, especially in Europe, largely due to concerns over player welfare.

The global footballers' union FIFPro and the European Leagues association filed a complaint with the European Commission in October against FIFA, accused of abusing its dominant position by packing the calendar.

The Champions League was also expanded by UEFA this season and some players, including Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, have raised the prospect of a strike.

""I think we are close to that. I think if you ask any player he will say the same,"" said Rodri when asked in September if there was a possibility of players going on strike, shortly before suffering a season-ending knee injury.

""It is not the opinion of Rodri or whatever. I think it's the general opinion of the players.""

The tournament will feature 12 teams from Europe, six from South America and four each from Asia, Africa and North and Central America.

Auckland City and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami complete the line-up.

Not all the reaction has been negative, with Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique insisting ""everyone"" would want to play.

""Once every four years there's this new, extremely exciting competition. Everyone wants to go to the Club World Cup,"" he said last year.

The tournament will be held at 12 venues across 11 cities in the United States, with the final at the MetLife Stadium, which will also host the 2026 World Cup final, in New Jersey.

According to the report, Northwest Hyderabad emerged as the dominant market, accounting for nearly 70% of total unit sales. The region, which includes Madhapur, Miyapur, Manikonda, Serilingampally, Tellapur, Narsingi, Patancheru and Gandi Maisamma recorded sales of 45,405 units valued at ₹ 71,926 crore.

Southwest Hyderabad followed, with 9,109 units sold in areas near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Katedan, Attapur and Balapur. The total value of homes sold in this region was ₹29,342 crore.

In contrast, eastern parts of Hyderabad recorded comparatively lower sales. Northeast Hyderabad, which includes Tirumalgiri, Alwal, parts of Secunderabad, Cherlapalli, Dammaiguda and Boduppal saw 6,279 units sold totalling ₹ 7,147 crore. Southeast Hyderabad recorded the lowest sales figures with 4,384 units sold for a total value of ₹ 5,522 crore. This region includes LB Nagar, Dilsukhnagar, Vanasthalipuram and Pedda Amberpet.

“The focus for long has been on the western part of Hyderabad. The government now needs to look east and focus on development there. When the policymakers start moving east, developers will automatically move there. The extreme focus on the western part of Hyderabad has also contributed to growing traffic congestion, as a majority of people are both living and working in that part of the city,” said V. Rajashekar Reddy, President of CREDAI Hyderabad.

The report also highlighted trends in the commercial real estate sector. In terms of office space, a demand of 13 million square feet was created, compared to a supply of 12.4 million square feet. The top office transactions included Google leasing 5.5 lakh square feet at Elegans Emperia, followed by Metlife Services East taking 1.5 lakh square feet at Prestige Skypark, HCA Global Services leasing 1.09 lakh square feet at Salarpuria Knowledge Park and Cigna leasing 1.06 lakh square feet at the same location.

Among developers, the Phoenix Group led the market with a 70% share, followed by Pranava Group at 17% and Modi Realty at 13%. IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) remained the dominant demand drivers, accounting for 49% of commercial space uptake, followed by healthcare at 18%, BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance) at 10%, and the automobile sector at 8%.

“Hyderabad’s commercial real estate sector is undergoing rapid expansion, with total Grade A office stock reaching 151.1 million square feet and 82.9 million square feet currently under construction,” said Jagannath Rao Bandari, General Secretary of CREDAI Hyderabad.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/will-achieve-ambitious-economic-agenda-by-elections-chidambaram/article4629904.ece,Will achieve ambitious economic agenda by elections: Chidambaram,18-Apr-13,"Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has assured global investors that their concerns over India’s economy will be put to rest and the government will achieve its “ambitious economic agenda” by next year’s Lok Sabha elections.

“Global industry wants India to succeed. India will succeed. I know this past year has caused a lot of concern, but this year is over and by elections we will achieve our ambitious economic agenda,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Wednesday at a closed door meeting with investors hosted by the US-India Business Council (USIBC) in New York.

Mr. Chidambaram is currently touring US cities to attract foreign investment and sell India’s growth story to investors as India grapples with a high current account deficit.

“India currently holds a record high current account deficit and FDI could be the key to closing that gap,” USIBC said in a statement.

USIBC said top global industry leaders discussed with the Finance Minister the opportunities that exist in India and candidly addressed some of the challenges companies face in the market which affects investor sentiment.

The CEOs of Fortune 100 companies discussed a range of issues including infrastructure, retail, agriculture, life sciences, financial services, legal services, and real estate.

“We commend Minister Chidambaram for his leadership during these complex times. The American business community continues to look to India as a partner in the global economy ripe with investment opportunities.

“My colleagues and I remain committed to working collaboratively with Government of India and Indian industry to identify innovative solutions to India’s challenges,” USIBC Chairman and MasterCard president & CEO Ajay Banga said.

Among those were present at the USIBC meeting included PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, The McGraw Hill Companies President and CEO Harold McGraw Chairman, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Amway President Doug DeVos, President of Emerging Markets, Pfizer Olivier Brandicourt and MetLife CFO John Hele.

Founded in 1975, USIBC is a leading business advocacy association comprising nearly 400 of America’s and India’s top companies focused to enhancing the U.S.-India commercial relationship.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/merged-psbs-must-cut-stake-in-insurers/article29363424.ece,Merged PSBs must cut stake in insurers,07-Sep-19,"After the merger of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four, two of them will hold over 15% stake in two different insurance companies, individually.

According to insurance regulations, a bank cannot hold more than 15% stake in more than one insurance company.

“Having more than 15% stake in an insurance company gives the status of the promoter to the entity. One entity cannot be a promoter of two insurance companies,” a senior insurance industry official said. “So, the banks have to completely exit one insurance company or cut stake to 15%,” the official added. Two sets of merger-bound PSBs will hold stakes in two different insurance companies, post the merger. One is Punjab National-Oriental Bank of Commerce-United Bank of India combine and another is the Union Bank-Andhra Bank-Corporation Bank combine.

In the first combine both PNB and OBC hold stakes in two different insurers. PNB has a 30% stake in PNB Metlife Life India Insurance Company while OBC holds 23% in Canara-HSBC-OBC Life Insurance. So, the merged entity —  PNB — will hold over 15% stakes in both the  companies.

In the second combine, Union Bank holds 25% stake in Star Union Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Company while Andhra Bank holds 30% stake in India-First Life Insurance Company. So, the merged entity — Union Bank — will have more than 15%  in both the life insurers.

However, bank officials said they were not in a hurry to cut stake as that could impact valuations. Banks would wait for an initial public offering (IPO) to offload stakes.

“We are not in a hurry to sell stake. After the merger, when there is an IPO of one of the companies, we will reduce stake,” said a top official from one of the merger-bound banks.

Banks will have to get the permission of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) — the insurance regulator — for holding over 15% stake in two insurers for a while, that is, till the IPO. Bank mergers are expected to be completed by March 2020 and it is unlikely  insurers would like to hit the capital markets, especially when the markets are choppy.

Interestingly, PNB Metlife was planning an IPO last year but postponed its plans due to market conditions.

OBC had also been planning to divest stake in Canara-HSBC-OBC Life Insurance last year but the plan was shelved.

IDBI Bank, in which LIC has a majority stake, also has an insurance arm in IDBI-Federal Life Insurance  in which it holds 48% stake.

The bank has now started the process of exiting the life insurance company.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Lionel-Messi-retires-from-international-football/article60569883.ece,Lionel Messi retires from international football,27-Jun-16,"Ace footballer Lionel Messi on Monday announced retirement from International Football after Argentina's loss in Copa America final.

Chile stunned Argentina to win the Copa America Centenario in a penalty shootout as Messi's title curse struck again.

Messi, a five-time FIFA player of the year, winner of four Champions League titles and eight Spanish La Liga crowns with Barcelona, was crushed. Much of his nation had counted on him to bring home its first major title since 1993.

Playing two days after his 29th birthday, Messi lost a final for the third year in a row and the fourth time overall with Argentina.

A crowd of 82,076 filled MetLife Stadium the largest to see a soccer game in New Jersey and many wore his No. 10 jersey in Argentina’s blue and white and Barcelona’s navy and red.

""For me the national team is over. I've done all I can, it hurts not to be a champion,"" the 29-year-old Barcelona superstar told reporters after his fourth defeat in a major final with Argentina.

Messi has been dealing with a right leg problem since the group stage win over Chile on June 25. He missed the first-round finale four days later but played the entire match in the quarterfinal victory over Ecuador last Thursday.

""Leo is good. He will be playing tomorrow,” Albiceleste coach Lionel Scaloni said Monday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

At 37, Messi has 13 Copa America goals and is four behind the record shared by Argentina's Norberto Méndez and Brazil's Zizinho but hasn't scored in this year's tournament.

“It's an easy decision for me,” Scaloni said. “It's a fairly honest decision: I ask him how he feels. If he says I'm not good,' then he will play the last 30 minutes. When he's available, he will play.” 	Seeking a record 16th Copa America title, Argentina beat Canada 2-0 in the June 20 tournament opener when Messi set up second-half goals by Julián Álvarez and Lautaro Martínez.

“We didn't do well enough with Messi last match. He was able to run free at our goalkeeper too much,"" said Jesse Marsch, the American hired as Canada's coach in May. “We all know he's the greatest player to ever play the game.” 	Argentina outshot Canada 19-10, including 9-2 on target, and had 64% possession.

“It's more of (an) advantage that we were able to play against them than it was for them to play against us,” Marsch said.

Both teams are coming off quarterfinal wins on penalty kicks. Canada, an invited guest from North America, defeated Venezuela.

In the other semifinal, Uruguay plays Colombia on Wednesday night in Charlotte, North Carolina. The championship is Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.

Argentina will have four days' rest, one more than Canada, but both teams are coming off 90-minute matches. Tournament regulations call for extra time to be used only if needed in the final.

Argentina is seeking to win its third major title after the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup and to equal the feat of Spain, which won the European Championship in 2008 and '12 along with the 2010 World Cup. The Albiceleste are tied with Uruguay for most Copa America titles with 15.

Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez has won four straight shootouts, against Colombia in the 2021 Copa semifinals, vs. the Netherlands in the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals and against France in the final, then vs. Ecuador last week.

Martinez, 6-foot-5, constantly shuffling his feet and a chatterbox trying to distract opponents, saved eight of 18 shots, stopping Colombia's Davinson Sánchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona; the Netherlands' Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis; France's Kingsley Coman; and Ecuador's Ángel Mena and Alan Minda.

Canada was eliminated in the group stage of its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022. It won the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup after gaining the title of a predecessor tournament, the 1985 CONCACAF Championship.

“We're playing against the best team in the world,” said Cyle Larin, Canada's career leader with 29 goals. “We have a lot of speed and power, but I think over those days we've been together we've been growing.”

The repositories will be charging the insurance firms for each transaction done according to Viiveck Verma, Executive Director, Karvy Insurance Repository Limited.

Karvy was one among the five firms licensed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to be the insurance repositories. The rest four are, NSDL Database management Limited, Central Insurance Repository Limited, SHCIL Projects Limited and CAMS Repository Services Limited.

“There are over 42 crore policy holders in life and health insurance segments. We are ready with the best infrastructure possible to facilitate electronic services and transactions. Our unique selling point is our mobile platform for wider reach,” Viiveck said. As per T.S Vijayan, Chairman IRDA, the transaction charge by repositories could be around Rs 25.

The management cost of each policy is expected to come down from Rs. 120 per policy to Rs. 25 per annum according to Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram who inaugurated the repositories in Hyderabad. The system enables policy holders buy and keep insurance policies in electronic form and eliminate paper and associated risks. The repositories will be paid directly by the insurers and policy holders are not charged.

This apart, the system enables customers take an informed decision according to Dr. Amarnath Ananthanarayanan, CEO & MD of Bharti AXA General Insurance Company Limited. “Customers can compare and evaluate the mutual funds and insurance policies and take a view through the system,” he said.

The insurance firms, on their part, have already started acting on the expected changes in the system. “We have already tied up with all the five players and started offering digital options to customers. We are ready with digital database and digital stamp,” said Rajesh Relan, MD and Country manager, PNB MetLife India. Repository system requires customers open an electronic Insurance Account (eIA) with the repository.

She's nervous as not only is this her first performance for the season, but what adds to the stress is that she will be dancing to her songs from                         Bajirao Mastani         and seated among the audience will be her director Sanjay Leela Bhansali who is flying in all the way from India to see this.

Deepika has been making news for her projects in the west. Fans and media are curious to know why she would not be giving us any Bollywood release this year and why will it be only a Hollywood flick                         xXx: The Return of Xander Cage        .

""For me I do not treat a film as coming from Hollywood or Bollywood. It's the script I read first. I need to know if I will love doing it and it’s only after that I take up roles. I will take up roles when they excite me or when I am ready. This experience is special for me and I am very excited about it.""

I prod further and ask her how different or similar are two industries and she is quick to answer. ""Wow I was waiting for someone to ask me this. If I have to say I did not miss anything at all and the only thing that was different was the location then you will realise as a film industry where we stand. The journey of Indian cinema has been amazing. The growth be it technically, content, or in the films we are on par with Hollywood. It was so comforting to know I did not miss anything.""

Personally however, there were many firsts shooting in the west. Staying by herself in an apartment, cooking meals and doing her laundry, Deepika loved each part of this. From taking her candles and photo frames to cooking meals be it                         rasam         or                         sambar         she enjoyed it all. ""There were many Indian restaurants in Toronto so finding North Indian food was not a problem so I cooked my sambar and rasam. I would ask people coming to visit me to bring me pre mixes and masala packets,"" she adds.

Coming back to IIFA she admits that though it's her first time in Madrid she loves Spain.

"" I am loving it. Music, love, warmth, food, generosity...There so many similarities between the two countries and it's a good way to showcase what we are doing with our movies,"" she adds.

While passing the order late Friday, SEBI said the entities have not obtained any registration from the regulator though the ULIPs launched by them had an investment component in the nature of mutual funds.

“I hereby direct the entities...not to issue any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money from investors by way of new or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from SEBI,” said Prashant Saran, wholetime SEBI member in an order.

The other insurance companies against whom SEBI passed an order are Aegon Religare Life, Aviva Life, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla Sunlife, HDFC Standard Life, ING Vysya Life, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life, Max New York Life, Metlife India and Reliance Life.

The order said ULIPs launched by the insurance companies were prima facie found to be akin to the mutual fund schemes.

While the SEBI regulates mutual funds and their schemes, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) oversees functioning of insurance companies.

Indian cinema has of late thrown its door open to an array of biopics of men and women with remakable lives for audiences to relive. Mahanati, which released this week, based on Savitri’s life, narrated the making of a genius, and the unfurling of a tragedy.

NTR and Chiranjeevi, are two other names whose biopics will get a red carpet at the box office when they happen. Also in the making is Yatra, a biopic on the former chief minister Y S Rajasekhar Reddy.

Biopics are also being proposed on severalsportspersons like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, and their coach Pullela Gopichand. Dhyan Chand, Mithali Raj and Abhinav Bindra are some other names whose stories have attracted auteurs.

Mary Kom and Milkha Singh have proven that India is a treasure trove of attractive stories (too bad Hollywood beat us to Ramanujam’s tale — again a brilliant story outside sports that has twists and turns which can put the most imaginative fiction to shame). In fact, we are only scraping the surface when it comes to inspirational tales that can be adopted for the silver screen. Here are a few names from the distant and the not-so-distant past that could keep the genre of biopics afloat for long. .

Potti Sreeramulu



Chiranjeevi’s                         Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy         turns the spotlight on revolutionaries from this part of the country. ‘Amarajeevi’ Potti Sreeramulu, one of Gandhi’s favourite followers, who went on a hunger strike to persuade the Indian government to form a separate state for the Telugu-speaking population under the Madras Presidency. His death due to fasting led to the declaration of a separate Andhra Pradesh State. Earlier too, Sreeramulu had fasted several times in favour of Dalit rights, a subject that is still relevant today.

Tanguturi Prakasam





A sobriquet like ‘Andhra Kesari’ reveals a lot about Andhra’s first chief minister. Tanguturi Prakasham ‘Pantulu’was a successful lawyer and freedom fighter known for his bravado.  he didn’t shirk from taking on even the likes of Nehru and Gandhi. His political life was a roller-coaster and his story has everything — revolution, reforms, debates, ego clashes and the rise-fall-rise pattern of great lives.

The first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal — do we need a greater reason for the story of this weightlifter to be told? For someone hailing from a small village like Voosavanipeta in Srikakulam, the journey to world glory in a sport like weightlifting is a tale for the generations. Her greatness lies in the fact that the Olympic medal was just one in a long list of achievements, including a gold in the World Weightlifting Championships.

The ‘Mozart of Madras’ and one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in 2009, AR Rahman, in his glittering career has won everything — the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and the Grammy, not to mention six National Awards. As his title ‘Isai Puyal’ (music storm) suggests, the great man broke onto the scene in his 20s with the genre-bending OST for Roja and Indian music was never the same. Who wouldn’t want to see his story on screen?

His                         Harivarasanam         is the lullaby played at Sabarimala temple every night to put Lord Ayyappa to sleep. This for a man made to wait for decades to enter some famous temples, owing to his religion, is nothing but a triumph for music. A student of several illustrious greats of Carnatic music, Yesudas, despite financial constraints, rose up to the stature of Gana Gandharvan, recording 80,000 songs over half a century in more than half a dozen languages.

25000 concerts in a career which started when he was all of six isn’t even the most astounding fact about the great maestro, known not just for his excellence in Carnatic music but for enriching it further with new ragas and an innovative tala system that he created.  If we need a biopic sans drama, just to feel good reminiscing the remarkable achievements of a great man, made Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 2005, this is the story to behold.

In a cricket crazy country, the story of the first captain of the Indian cricket team in Tests is definitely one of interest. Hailed by historians including Ramachandra Guha, Nayudu, a real-life Bhuvan (think                         Lagaan        ) probably captured the imagination of a country with his scintillating knock of 153 in 116 minutes for the Hindus against the MCC Team in the Bombay Gymkhana Grounds. That innings in 1926 probably led to India’s elevation to Test status way before Independence and cricket’s rise in the nation.

After an impressive educational record (an M Tech from IIT Kharagpur and an MBA from IIM Calcutta), Mastan Babu pursued his passion for mountaineering, creating a world record in 2006, as the then fastest Seven Summiteer (climbing the highest mountain peak in each continent, known as Seven Summits, in just 172 days). Bad weather in the Andes led to his tragic demise, at the age of 41, during one of his solo missions.

https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Spain-joins-forces-with-Bollywood-to-boost-tourism/article14431841.ece,Spain joins forces with Bollywood to boost tourism,19-Jun-16,"Spain is coaxing Indian moviemakers to use its colourful fiestas and historic monuments as settings for their films, in a move to grab a bigger share of India's fast-growing overseas tourism market.

As part of its bid to lure visitors from India Madrid will host next weekend the annual International Indian Film Academy awards (IIFA), dubbed the ""Bollywood Oscars"".

In global tourism, Spain ranks as the third most visited country, but it now wants to diversify its tourism base beyond the traditional northern European sunseekers that account for the bulk of its visitors.

Among the Bollywood stars who will attend the awards ceremony in Spain will be actor Hrithik Roshan, the star of the 2011 coming-of-age movie                         Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara        , which was produced in close collaboration with the Spanish tourism promotion agency, Turespana.

The film about three friends on a pre-marriage road trip across Spain includes scenes at the ‘La Tomatina’ festival in the town of Bunol as well as at Pamplona's San Fermin bull running festival.

With scenes also set in Barcelona, Seville and the beaches of the Costa Brava, the movie was the first major Indian production to shoot extensively in various locations in Spain.

It was also the highest grossing Bollywood film of 2011.

""There was an immediate impact in the number of people requesting entry visas to travel to Spain,"" the director of the London office of Turespana, Enrique Ruiz de Lera, who led the agency's talks with the producers of the movie, told AFP.

The year after its release, 60,444 Indians visited Spain, nearly double the 2011 figure, according to the industry and tourism ministry. Last year 85,000 Indians visited Spain.

Lonely Planet in 2013 launched a guide to Spain aimed specifically at the Indian market and travel agencies still advertise tours to the locations featured in                         Zindagi..        .

India's ambassador to Spain, Vikram Misri, said the film ""was singlehandedly responsible for making Spain a household name in India and increasing tourism from India"".

Cruise ship movie

Turespana suggested locations for filming but gave no direct financial aid to cover the cost of making the movie, Ruiz de Lera said.

Instead it helped secure permits to film at key sites and negotiate deals on hotel rooms and transportation for the crew to lower production costs. ""We helped a lot with contacts so filming in Spain was easy,"" Ruiz de Lera said.

In return, the producers of the film agreed to include a short advertisement before the start of the movie promoting Spain by award-winning Spanish director Julio Medem.

Spain and India signed a film co-production agreement the year after                         Zindagi…         was released.

Turespana regularly takes part in film location fairs in India to pitch the tax breaks and other incentives available to movie producers who shoot in Spain.

Since                         Zindagi...        , another ""five or six"" Indian films have been shot in Spain although none was as popular at the box office, the director of the Mumbai office of Turespana, Ignacio Ducasse, told AFP.

They include one by                         Zindagi…         director Zoya Akhtar —                         Dil Dhadakne Do         featuring actor Anil Kapoor — which was filmed on a ship belonging to Pullmantur, Spain's biggest cruise operator.

The comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family on a 10-day Mediterranean cruise was released last year and it includes scenes shot in Barcelona as well as in the various bars, restaurants and open decks of the ship.

Stars in ad campaign

Kapoor, 59, best known internationally for his role in the 2008 film                         Slumdog Millionaire        , said during a visit to Madrid in March to promote IIFA that he is ""looking forward to coming back again and again to Spain"".

Tourism is crucial for the Spanish economy, accounting for around 11 percent of gross domestic product and one in nine jobs, according to the tourism ministry. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation predicts India will account for 50 million outbound tourists by 2020, up from just 18 million in 2014.

Turespana plans to create an ad campaign to appeal to this rising tide of tourists using images of Bollywood celebrities enjoying themselves in Madrid at the awards show. The ceremony itself is expected to bring 15,000 visitors to the Spanish capital during the week of the show.

""We are counting that the arrival of several thousand Indian friends for the (awards) ceremony will help bring millions of their compatriots in the coming years,"" Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs, Ignacio Ybanez, said earlier this year.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sindhu-hopes-to-turn-the-tide-in-upcoming-tournaments-this-month/article28284473.ece,Sindhu hopes to turn the tide in upcoming tournaments this month,04-Jul-19,"Olympic silver medallist P V Sindhu on Thursday admitted that her season so far has not been “great” but expressed hope of turning the tide in the upcoming events, beginning with Indonesia Open from July 16.

Sindhu has played in six tournaments so far this year without reaching a final. She reached the semifinals in India Open in March and Singapore Open in April.

“(It) has not been really great. But, it was ok. I am satisfied. But, I think I have to do much better,” Sindhu told reporters on the sidelines of PNB Metlife announcing the launch of Junior Badminton Championship-5.

Asked what went wrong in the last six months during which she did not win any major tournament, Sindhu said, “Nothing went wrong. But on the day, sometimes, you might not just give your 100 per cent. Sometimes, you might just make too many mistakes.

“That’s why I said I have to be satisfied. It’s not that I am happy. But, you always have to think that there is always a next time,” she said.

The 23-year-old Sindhu said she has worked hard on her game during the one month-long break she got and is confident of doing well in Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.

“We have got almost one month of break. I have been in my top level and working hard. There has been enough time to prepare for the next three tournaments, that is Indonesia, Japan and Thailand. So, I am confident that I can do well and I can give my 100 per cent,” said the 2016 Olympics silver medallist.

The Indonesia Open begins on July 16 while Japan Open and Thailand Open will start on July 23 and July 30.

During the break, she said she has worked on her physical and mental fitness to be in good shape.

“I have worked on mental as well as physical (fitness). Matches have been really long nowadays. Everything is like a chain where you need to touch up on everything. It’s not just that you do physical and leave the skill part. I think I have been working out on skill a lot more,” she said.

“Because, now the game has changed a lot. A lot of people have been working out on their skills and physical. I think it is very important to keep yourself fit as well as in your skill work, you need to be very much perfect as well. So, I have been working on that,” she said when asked if she worked on something new.

She said the players need to have variation in their game to achieve success in major tournaments.

“Every time, we need to change. Because, it is not the same every time. Not only you, your opponents change their game,” she said.

“Now, there are video cameras, there are videos, analysing and doing everything. Even though we go with one strategy, when you go on to court, every point can be comparatively different. That’s what I feel,” she added.

Sindhu said her training with new coaches, who have come a few of months ago, has been good. She is currently training with Korean Kim Ji Hyun and hoped that it would work well for her.

The players can learn new techniques from every coach as each one has different thinking and experience, she said.

Sindhu said each tournament is important for her though she aimed to win a medal in the Tokyo Olympics next year.

Premium",08-Sep-23,"The story so far: On August 31, U.S. musician Taylor Swift announced that her spectacular Eras Tour will premiere as a three-hour movie across theatres in North America on October 13. The tour, currently in its second leg in South America, will travel to Europe and a few spots in Asia before returning to North America in 2024.

It is already being touted as the biggest concert tour ever by a musician, predicted to oust the likes of John Lennon, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay.

Ms. Swift first announced 27 shows on November 1, 2022, across 20 cities in the U.S. However, unprecedented public demand led her to expand the first leg of the tour across the U.S. to 53 shows, with the maximum number of shows (six) at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

She played the first show in Glendale, Arizona on March 17; it was temporarily renamed “Swift City” by Mayor Jerry Weiers in her honour.

Other cities also followed suit – Pittsburgh became Swiftsburgh, Minneapolis became Swiftie-apolis, and Santa Clara was renamed Swiftie Clara. Ms. Swift was also named the honorary mayor of Santa Clara.

QuestionPro, a U.S.-based survey software company, estimates that the Eras Tour could generate $5 billion in economic impact for the U.S. economy – more than the GDP of 50 countries across the world.

The record for the highest-grossing music tour of all time currently belongs to Elton John who, according to Billboard, capped off his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour in July 2023 with $939 million.

When Ms. Swift first announced her tour, Billboard predicted that it could generate more than $300 million. Since then, she almost doubled the number of shows in the U.S. during the first leg and announced international dates for South America, Europe, and Asia.

According to Pollstar, Ms. Swift’s Eras Tour has already surpassed the 2023 collection of the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which started in 2018 and took a break during the COVID-19 pandemic years.

Tickets for Ms. Swift’s Eras Tour shows in the U.S. ranged from $49 to $449, while VIP packages cost $199 to $899. According to Pollstar, the average ticket price for the show was $253.56.

Tickets on resale websites, however, raked in thousands of dollars. Ticketmaster, the official online ticket seller for the Eras Tour, crashed when people first queued up virtually to buy tickets, eventually prompting a Senate hearing over concerns of monopoly of concert ticket sales.

In a statement, the company said that over 3.5 million people registered for the presale. “Historically, around 40% of invited fans actually show up and buy tickets, and most purchase an average of 3 tickets. Around 1.5 million people were sent codes to join the onsale for all 52 show dates, including the 47 sold by Ticketmaster. The remaining 2 million were placed on a waiting list,” Ticketmaster said.

The company received 3.5 billion total system requests, four times its previous peak. “Never before has a Verified Fan onsale sparked so much attention – or traffic. This disrupted the predictability and reliability that is the hallmark of our Verified Fan platform,” the statement added.

Ticketmaster sold over two million tickets for the Eras Tour on November 15 — the most for an artist on a single day.

The non-availability of tickets is a possible reason for exorbitant resale prices.  According to TicketIQ, an event ticket search engine, the average listing price of tickets for the Eras Tour when it was first announced was $2,183 on the secondary market.

QuestionPro research also suggests that the average attendee spent around $1,300 per show on tickets, merchandise, food and drinks, costumes, travel and other expenses. Around 49% of attendees had household income of less than $50,000, while 25% each fall in the $50,000-$100,000 and over $100,000 categories.

Most of the Eras Tour shows were sold out, with many tailgating outside venues hoping for resale tickets— calling it “Taylorgating” or “Taygating” after the singer. Stadiums like MetLife in East Rutherford and Gillette in Foxborough specifically asked tailgaters to not hinder traffic and ticket holders.

The average attendance of Eras Tour concerts was 53,900 according to Pollstar; while CNN, quoting QuestionPro data, said that around 72,459 attended each show on an average.

Ms. Swift broke multiple attendance records during the first U.S. leg of the Eras Tour. In Glendale, she recorded an attendance of over 140,000 people – almost the double of the Super Bowl event held in the same stadium in February 2023.

According to the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, she became the first-ever artist to perform three straight nights for an attendance record of 210,607.

She also set the record for biggest all-time Nissan Stadium concert attendance record for two nights in a row (since broken by singer Ed Sheeran).

Ms. Swift then went on to set to host record-breaking shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford and Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.

The Eras Tour drove businesses in the cities on its circuit, giving local economies a much-needed boost since COVID-19. According to Smith Travel Research (STR) reports, hotels in Eras Tour stops were “bejewelled”, with its impact, with around $208 million in additional U.S. hotel room revenue. This estimate  only records the impact of the concert nights and does not account for extended fan stays and other offshoots.

Pittsburgh and Nashville specifically doubled their revenue per available room (RevPAR) from shoulder weeks. Seattle, which led all host cities in absolute RevPAR ($293), broke its own record on July 22 (the first night of the Eras Tour in the city) with a RevPAR of $317.

Average daily rates (ADR) of concert days ranged from as high as $307 in Seattle to $138 in Houston, STR research said. ADR premiums, however, varied based on the normal seasonal patterns of the markets. Most markets made the best of the opportunity with double-digit ADR gains as the norm, led by Pittsburgh with a 70% increase followed by Nashville with a 51% increase.

The contribution of Ms. Swift’s tour to the hotel industry was also noted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the pandemic started, “in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city,” the bank noted in an official statement.

Chicago also noted a boom in hotel revenues. According to local reports, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced at a press conference that the State’s hotel revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30 reached $309 million. The pre-pandemic 2019 record was set at $296 million. This was in part due to the Eras Tour as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting and the James Bear Foundation awards in the city.

The Holiday Inn hotel in Glendale was sold out the day the Eras Tour was announced, Business Insider reported, quoting a representative. Other hotels in the vicinity of the State Farm Stadium were also booked to capacity, while the ones that weren’t were available for exorbitant prices, the report added.

Downtown Cincinnati, where Ms. Swift played two shows on June 30 and July 1, registered more than $2.6 million in hotel revenue for just two days, Visit Cincy reported. Hamilton County, situated at a 20-minute drive from Paycor Stadium where Ms. Swift performed, garnered $5.3 million in the same time period.

“The economic impact Ms. Swift creates is staggering, as fans travel from far and wide to attend her concerts, filling hotels, restaurants, and local attractions Swift’s influence on tourism is a testament to her ability to captivate audiences and drive economic growth,” said Julie Calvert, President and CEO of Visit Cincy. Even the tailgate party at The Banks in Cincinnati registered a footfall of 40,691, the report added.

Friendship bracelets are considered an integral part of the Swiftie experience, and concert attendees also contributed with their creativity.

Michaels, a multi-city American retail chain for craft supplies  (also celebrating its 50th anniversary this year), saw a more than 40% increase in the jewellery category, which includes jewellery-making kits and materials for friendship bracelets, since mid-April, the company informed The Hindu.

In cities where Ms. Swift performed, Michaels noted a whopping 300% increase in sales in categories like beads and jewellery on days leading up to the concerts. Pennsylvania saw the largest jewellery category sales increase among all States – 500% – thanks to  two stops, in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The largest single-stop sales increase was noted to be at more than 400% in Detroit, the store said.

“While we couldn’t have anticipated the trend would take off quite the way it did, our merchandising team was quick to identify it, anticipate what our customers would need, and ensure our stores were well stocked. We also began offering bracelet-making as part of our in-store classes and events, and saw our store teams tap into their own creativity to build special bracelet-making displays that engaged customers,” the company said in a statement.

More than 22,000 bracelets were reportedly made as part of the in-store classes. “We saw a large increase in demand for supplies for all kinds of creative projects during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this was the first instance in recent memory we’ve seen demand spike so acutely around a specific pop culture event and product category,” the statement added.

Bead World, a supplies store in Seattle, said that they registered the highest sales in their 34-year history in July before Ms. Swift was to perform in the city, a local media report said.

While the 2023 U.S. leg of the Eras Tour might be over, there is more to come. The concert movie will be released across theatres in North America on October 13. The announcement was made on August 31 by Ms. Swift on her social media accounts, and people rushed to buy tickets, setting a record for the highest-ever single-day advance ticket sales revenue in the 103-year history of AMC Theatres. The ticket sale generated $26 million in revenue in a day, breaking the previous record of $16.9 million, held by Tom Holland and Zendaya starrer Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Ms. Swift will now continue the Eras Tour in November 2023 with shows in Argentina and Brazil, before going to Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Europe, and then circling back to North America in late 2024.

The Eras Tour also drove up application for United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s credit cards in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam by 45% in July compared to the previous month, Bloomberg reported. The bank’s cardholders were eligible for an exclusive presale of Ms. Swift’s concert tickets.

Hotels in Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Cardiff, where the singer is scheduled to play in June and August 2024, are already sold out, TheGuardian reported, quoting Travelodge.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/IRDA-asks-insurance-companies-to-ignore-SEBI-order/article16365559.ece,IRDA asks insurance companies to ignore SEBI order,11-Apr-10,"Insurance regulator IRDA has taken SEBI head on by setting aside a ban on ULIP by the market watchdog and asking 14 life insurance companies to continue their business as usual.

The finance ministry has opted to keep a safe distance from the ongoing controversy.

Unit-linked equity products (ULIPs) are insurance plans sold by life insurers where the money collected from consumers is invested into equity and debt markets and returns are linked to the same. Regulation of ULIPs has a bone of contention between the two regulators.

Moving swiftly within 24 hours of SEBI order, IRDA Chairman J Hari Narayan in a signed order has asserted that it is IRDA which will control the ULIPs, which are issued by the insurance companies.

Earlier on Friday, SEBI had banned 14 life insurance companies, including those belonging to the Tatas, Reliance Anil Ambani Group, SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC, from issuing ULIP products.

SEBI Chairman C.B. Bhave while speaking to reporters in Kolkata on Saturday declined to speak on the ban on 14 insurance companies from selling ULIP without its approval.

“I am not going to comment on the order,” he had said.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its Friday evening order had also said that entities registered with SEBI could operate such schemes as they are in the nature of mutual funds.

Even as the two regulators continue the turf war, Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla distanced himself from the controversy saying it was a matter between the two regulators. “It’s a matter between regulators, so they have to decide.”

The turf war concerns the nature of ULIPs which account for over 50 per cent of the total life insurance business in the country.

As on March 31, 2009, the total funds under the management of life insurance sector stood at over Rs 9 lakh crore of, accroding to the Life Insurance Council’s figure.

The life insurance companies against whom SEBI passed the order are SBI Life, ICICI Prudential, Tata AIG, Aegon Religare Life, Aviva Life, Bajaj Allianz, Bharti AXA, Birla Sunlife, HDFC Standard Life, ING Vysya Life, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life, Max New York Life, Metlife India and Reliance Life.

IRDA’s order, however, will provide some relief to these life insurance companies.

The order issued by SEBI banned 14 insurance companies from issuing ""any offer document, advertisement, brochure soliciting money from investors or raise money from investors by way of new and/or additional subscription for any product (including ULIPs) having an investment component in the nature of mutual funds, till they obtain the requisite certificate of registration from SEBI.""

Withing 24 hours of the SEBI's director, insurance regulator IRDA fought back with its own order that said, ""all the 14 insurance companies which are mentioned in the order of SEBI are directed to note that notwithstanding the said Order of the SEBI, they shall continue to carry out insurance business as usual including offering, marketing and servicing ULIPs in accordance with the Insurance Act.”

Describing the action of SEBI as ""wholly misconceived and without jurisdiction"", IRDA said it would have brought the insurance industry to a ""stand still"" seriously jeopardising the interests of the policy holders and the interests of the insurers.

It would have resulted in ""complete drying up of the revenue flows to the insurance companies which could disrupt the payment of benefits on maturity, on death and on other admissible claims, putting the policyholder and the general public to irreparable financial loss.

""The financial position of the insurers will be seriously jeopardized thus destabilizing the market and upsetting financial stability"", IRDA added.

About 7.03 crore ULIP polices involving a total premium of Rs.90,645 crores were in force in 2008-09. As many as 16.7 lakhs policies were sold with a premium of Rs.44611 crores during April-February 2009-10.

https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ULIPs-lock-in-period-raised-to-5-years/article16271171.ece,ULIPs: lock-in period raised to 5 years,28-Jun-10,"After winning the turf war with the Securities and Exchange Board of India over control over unit-linked insurance products (ULIPs), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on Monday tightened the norms for these schemes by raising the lock-in period and raising the insurance cover on them.

The lock-in period for all ULIPs has been increased from three years to five years, including the top-up premiums, thereby making them long-term financial instruments, which basically provide risk protection, the IRDA said in the guidance note, released on Monday.

Besides insurance cover on such products, the premium has gone up to 10 times of the first-year premium compared to existing five times.

The fight between SEBI and IRDA was basically on the issue whether ULIPs are investment product or insurance schemes. ULIPs are those insurance products the value of which are linked to market price of the stocks in which a part of those money is invested.

IRDA tried to increase the insurance aspects of ULIPs. As was expected, commission and expenses have been reduced by evenly distributing it through out the lock-in period.

“Charges on ULIPs are mandated to be evenly distributed during the lock-in period to ensure that high front-ending of expenses is eliminated,” IRDA said, adding that all limited premium ULIPs, other than single premium products, shall have premium paying term of at least five years.

The regulator said that insurers will provide a mortality cover or a health cover to all ULIPs, other than pension and annuity products, thereby increasing the risk cover component on them.

Customers to benefit

Commenting on the guidelines, MetLife India Managing Director Rajesh Relan said, “prima facie the circular benefits the customer. This is yet another step taken by the IRDA to add more value to the policyholder and make the products more transparent. This will also improve persistency and provide long-term and sustainable income stream for distributors.”

However, Mr. Relan pointed out, “the full impact of these steps on industry players is yet to be ascertained, as we would seek further clarifications on certain clauses.”

As per the new guidelines, all ULIP pension or annuity products will offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent annually or as specified by the IRDA from time-to-time. This will protect the life time savings of pensioners from any adverse market fluctuations at the time of maturity, the circular said. All insurers are directed to conform to these features so that they can introduce products with due approval from the IRDA. From September 1, all ULIPs shall conform to this circular, the regulator said.

With a view to smoothening the cap on charges, the capping been rationalised to ensure that the difference in yield is capped from the fifth year onwards, the notification said. This will not only reduce the overall charges on these products, but also smoothen the charge structure for the policyholder, it added.

Besides, the IRDA has also amended regulations to further tighten the code of conduct of corporate agents to ensure that a customer does not deal with any unlicensed person. The regulations have also been amended to ensure that there is no scope for any kind of remuneration other than commission where sale has been effected, it said.

This measure will reduce the expenses of the insurer, thereby lowering premiums to be paid by the policyholder, it added.

https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/Copa-America-Centenario-2016-Argentina-vs-Chile-finals/article60575740.ece,Messi ready for crowning glory in Copa final,25-Jun-16,"Lionel Messi will bid to gild his legacy as the greatest footballer of his generation in New York on Sunday by ending Argentina's 23-year wait for a major title in a dream final against holders Chile in the Copa America Centenario.

For Messi's many millions of admirers, the five-time world footballer of the year has already achieved enough in his glittering career to be considered in the same bracket as Pele and Diego Maradona.

Yet the only hole in the Barcelona superstar's CV — a major tournament title with Argentina — is invariably, and somewhat unfairly, cited as a justification to delay his elevation to football's pantheon.

That could all change on Sunday before a sell-out crowd of 81,000 at East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium, the home of the NFL's New York Giants, when Argentina face the Chileans in a rematch of last year's Copa America final.

It is the third final in as many years for Messi and his teammates, who suffered agonising defeats in the 2014 World Cup final against Germany and to the Chileans on penalties in Santiago last year.

On each occasion, Messi has borne the brunt of the backlash from critics in Argentina who trot out a familiar laundry list of grievances. He has no passion. He doesn't sing the anthem. He doesn't ""feel"" the shirt.

Barely a ball had been kicked in this Copa America before Maradona, a regular sniper, accused him of lacking “personality” and “leadership.”

Don't come back

Maradona amped up the rhetoric this week shortly after Argentina booked their place in the final with a 4-0 demolition of the United States.

“We will certainly win on Sunday... and if we don't win, they shouldn't come back,” Maradona told an Argentinian television network.

Messi is not above being angered by the criticism.

“I get annoyed by the people who attack you without thinking,” he said in a recent interview.

“We got to two finals. We didn't win. What can you do? But we got to the final. It's not like we lost in the last 16.”

So far in the United States, Messi has shown no sign of being overburdened by the pressure to end Argentina's wait for a title.

After missing Argentina's opening group match — a 2-1 win over Sunday's opponents Chile — he scored an electrifying 19-minute hat-trick against Panama after coming on as a substitute before going on to equal Gabriel Batistuta's Argentina goals record in the 4-1 quarterfinal win over Venezuela.

Against the US on Tuesday, he scored a magnificent curling freekick to become his country's leading international goalscorer with 55, while setting up two more goals in a magical all-round display.

He even found the time to sign the shirt of an autograph-hunting fan who sprinted onto the pitch at the start of the second half.

Messi determined

His smiling, laidback demeanor however masks a fierce determination to lift the title, revealing that Argentina have become a more formidable unit since suffering the pain of multiple final defeats.

“It's been almost a year since the last Copa America, and I think that made us stronger as a group, and as a team,” Messi said.

“We grew a lot, in a lot of ways, and above all, even though we didn't win, it helped us.”

Yet while Argentinian fans — and many neutrals — will be willing Messi to victory, Chile have shown that they are more than capable of pulling off another ambush.

Since the opening loss to Argentina on June 6, the Chileans have improved with each game to compile their best run of results since Juan Antonio Pizzi replaced Jorge Sampaoli as manager in January.

They humiliated Mexico with a 7-0 thrashing in the quarterfinals and polished off Colombia 2-0 in the semifinals.

“They attack and defend with great intensity, and if you make a mistake they can punish you,” Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said after the semi-final loss.

A dynamic, combative midfield led by Bayern Munich star Arturo Vidal will ensure that Argentina's skilled attackers such as Messi, Nicolas Gaitan and Ever Banega have nothing like the freedom to operate they have enjoyed so far.

And Chile's razor sharp attack, which features tournament top scorer Eduardo Vargas (six goals) and Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez, should also pose more questions than Argentina's back four has been required to answer en route to the final.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was honoured at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Oxon Hills, Maryland, by the NRA with the “Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award,” an honour named for the late actor who was an NRA president.

The award is a Kentucky long rifle that will stay at the NRA’s museum in Fairfax, Virginia. The NRA was not allowed to bring the weapon on stage, said Carolyn Meadows, an NRA official.

It was not immediately clear why the NRA was not able to present the long gun to the FCC chairman. The FCC, CPAC and the NRA did not immediately respond to questions. A Reuters reporter at the event said there were no visible prohibitions against weapons at the event but metal detectors were present before President Donald Trump’s address earlier on Friday.

At the event, Mr. Pai defended his aggressive approach to undoing numerous telecommunications regulations put in place under former President Barack Obama.

“Some people urged me to go for sacrifice bunts and singles and try to nibble around the edges, make some minor changes,” Mr. Pai said. “But I don’t play small ball.”

Mr. Pai canceled his appearance in January at a large consumer electronics event in Las Vegas after receiving deaths threats, sources told Reuters.

The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for Internet service providers like AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., conferring power over what content consumers can access and allowing them to offer paid fast lanes for certain content.

Face-off with Facebook

On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal.

On Thursday, 22 state attorneys general sued to block the repeal. Fight for the Future, a group that backs net neutrality, said in a tweet “Hunh” the NRA gave Mr. Pai an award that will “allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to censor websites and information about guns.”

Several corporations have cut ties with the NRA after the group launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high-school.

Insurer Chubb Ltd. said on Friday that it would stop underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defence shootings.

Insurance company MetLife Inc. ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members, while several rental car companies announced they were ending discount programmes for NRA members.

Ignoring warnings that the state’s business-friendly image could be tarnished, Republicans in the state legislature voted on Thursday to kill a tax break that would have saved Delta millions of dollars in sales tax on jet fuel. The proposal wasn’t controversial until Delta announced last weekend it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members.

“I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,” Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, said after his chamber gave final approval to a larger tax-cut bill that was stripped of the jet fuel tax exemption.

The Feb. 14 slayings of 17 students and educators in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle has prompted retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Dick’s Sporting Goods to tighten their gun sales policies. Meanwhile, Delta and other companies including MetLife and Hertz have ended business ties with the NRA.

                      Trump says some lawmakers too fearful of NRA to take action

Delta’s decision triggered a showdown with pro-gun lawmakers in Georgia, where the Atlanta-based airline is one of the largest employers with 33,000 employees statewide. Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the state Senate’s presiding officer, vowed on Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta.

“Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” tweeted Mr. Cagle, who is also running for governor.

GOP lawmakers amended a sweeping tax bill to eliminate a fuel-tax exemption worth at least an estimated $38 million to Delta and other airlines.

The Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all of the no votes. The House which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption before the Delta controversy erupted followed with a 135-24 vote.

Republican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an “unbecoming squabble” but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed.

Delta did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen had no immediate comment.

The Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul.

Mr. Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory on Thursday.

“Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it’s all about the product,” said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. “And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of.”

GOP Sen. Michael Williams, another gubernatorial candidate, praised Republicans for holding out in the face of criticism from the news media and corporate America.

“We’ve stayed strong,” Mr. Williams said. “We’ve even stayed strong against our own governor.”

Among Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta’s decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break.

“The small steps that Delta and Dick’s Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,” Mr. Williams said. “We’re the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing.”

Critics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia’s ability to lure businesses including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters.

“It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,” said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. “But will it be the dominant factor? I don’t think so.”

Addressing a global investors’ meet hosted by the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), Ms. Sitharaman said that the government has shown a strong record of ‘reform implementation in the last six years’ and showcased the ‘strong relief and reforms undertaken during the pandemic times’.

“Macro-economic stability, infrastructure-led economic growth opportunities, financial sector reforms and positioning as a strong player in global supply chains are just some of the ways India continues to rise as a global economic powerhouse,” she said, stressing that there was a significant decline in new COVID-19 infections and a decline in the second wave.

At the meeting attended by global investors such as Mastercard, Metlife, Prudential, Dell, Softbank and Warburg Pincus, the broad messaged conveyed by the Finance Minister included the vision to make India ‘self-reliant and modern’ through the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat programme and driven by 5 ‘I’s – Intent, Inclusion, Investment, Infrastructure and Innovation.

The Finance Minister said India is committed to forge a long term relationship with U.S. investors and proposes to meet them twice a year. “The continuous reforms make India a great place to do business and the highest ever GST collections shows the bright spot — more formalisation of economy and tax compliance,” Ms. Sitharaman told investors as per an official statement.

Emphasising India’s ‘continued macro-economic stability and resilience in economic recovery in the recent months’, the Finance Minister said India’s wide-ranging reforms continue to position the country as an attractive destination for foreign investors. There are ‘new opportunities emerging for foreign investors with recent FDI reforms, privatisation policy and PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme’, she pointed out.

“Innovation and R&D got a great potential. New opportunities emerging for foreign investors with recent FDI reforms privatisation policy and PLI scheme,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement, summarising her message at the USISPF meeting.

According to the Ministry, First Solar CEO Mark Widmar applauded ‘the effort done already towards the investment opportunities in India, especially with the combination of industrial policy and the trade barriers that have enabled this initiative’. He was also encouraged to see the vaccination and economic progress, the statement said.

Ms. Sitharaman underlined that India had 15 new unicorns in 2021, reflecting its growing startup ecosystem ‘to be amongst the best in the world’. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth told investors about the broad themes of the Union Budget and the far-reaching changes brought about.

Anchor Investors' (AIs) portion (5,92,96,853 equity shares) was subscribed at Rs 949 per equity share, the insurer said in an early morning filing to exchanges.

Out of the allocation of about 5.9 crore shares to AIs, 4.2 crore shares (71.12 per cent) were allocated to 15 domestic mutual funds through 99 schemes, the filing said.

Besides, investment was made by some domestic insurance companies and pension funds. Some of the prominent names in this category included ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, PNB Metlife Insurance, SBI Pension Fund and UTI Retirement Solutions Pension Fund Scheme.

Foreign participation included the Government of Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Government Pension Fund Global and BNP Investment LLP.

As per the prospectus, out of the 22.13 crore shares offered for sale, 5.93 crore shares were reserved for anchor investors.

The government by diluting 3.5 per cent stake in LIC would raise Rs 21,000 crore, the biggest ever IPO in the Indian market.  The previous such high fundraising was seen in the IPO of Paytm in 2021 at Rs 18,300 crore and Coal India in 2010 at Rs 15,200 crore.

The price band for LIC IPO is Rs 902-949 per equity share.

Policyholders will get a discount of Rs 60 per equity share, while retail investors and employees will get a discount of Rs 45 on each share.

Of the total shares on offer, over 9.88 crore shares are reserved for qualified institutional buyers and over 2.96 crore shares for non-institutional buyers. Up to 15,81,249 shares and 2,21,37,492 shares are reserved for employees and policyholders.

LIC would get listed and start trading on the stock exchanges on May 17.

LIC's embedded value, which is a measure of the consolidated shareholders' value in an insurance company, was pegged at about Rs 5.4 lakh crore as of September 30, 2021, by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors.

Based on investor feedback, the market value of government-owned LIC has been pegged at 1.1 times its embedded value or Rs 6 lakh crore.

LIC was formed by merging and nationalizing as many as 245 private life insurance companies on September 1, 1956, with an initial capital of Rs 5 crore.

Its product portfolio comprises 32 individual products (16 participating products and 16 non-participating products) and seven individual optional rider benefits. The insurer's group product portfolio comprises 11 group products.

As of December 2021, LIC had a market share of 61.6 per cent in terms of premiums or GWP, 61.4 per cent in terms of new business premium, 71.8 per cent in terms of the number of individual policies issued, and 88.8 per cent in terms of the number of group policies issued.

Lautaro Martínez scored off the last in a series of rebounds in the 88th minute, lifting the Albiceleste over Chile 1-0 on Tuesday night and into the quarterfinals with a game to spare.

LAUTARO MARTÍNEZ 🐂 pic.twitter.com/3BwopGlCeG

“The ball ended up right at me and I was able to convert it,"" said Martínez, who scored the second goal in last week's opening 2-0 win over Canada.

Messi started the leadup to the goal with a corner kick that was sent sent toward goal with a glancing header by defender Lisandro Martínez. The ball landed in front of goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, where Argentina's Giovani Lo Celso and Chile's Nicolás Fernández were wrestling. Lo Celso kicked the ball off Bravo and it rebounded to Chile's Igor Lichnovsky, who tried to poke it wide.

Lautaro Martínez, who entered in the 73rd, calmly one-timed that rebound into the roof of the net on Argentina's 21st shot. Players stood and waited for three minutes while the goal, Martínez's 26th for the national team, was confirmed in a video review.

“We deserved the win. It was not an easy match,"" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. ""We managed to win at the moment least expected.”

Argentina leads Group A with six points, followed by Canada with three, and Chile and Peru with one each. The Albiceleste finish the first round against Peru at Miami Gardens, Florida, on Saturday, when Canada meets Chile in Orlando, Florida.

Playing a day after his 37th birthday, Messi frequently flaunted his talent to spin around and slalom through defenders before an adoring sellout crowd of 81,106 at MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. Argentina dominated 22-3 in shots and 11-0 in corner kicks. Chile didn't take its first attempt until the 72nd minute.

Messi came the closest to scoring before Martínez with a 30-yard shot that glanced off the post to Bravo’s left in the 36th minute. Messi had received treatment on the thigh area of his right leg for nearly two minutes after getting kicked by Gabriel Suazo in the 24th.

Nicolás González’s shot from another Messi pass in the 62nd was parried off the crossbar by Bravo.

""I always have to save one or two every match. And I’m lucky to keep doing it,” Martínez said.

On the 46th anniversary of Argentina's first World Cup title, the teams returned to the stadium where Chile beat Argentina on penalty kicks in the 2016 Copa America final. That defeat prompted Messi to announce his international retirement only to reverse his decision seven weeks later.

At least 90% of the fans wore Argentina jerseys, most with Messi's name and No. 10.

There were some small brown patches behind one goal on a grass field installed at a stadium where the usual surface is artificial turf. The surface was narrow, with construction scheduled to allow a wider field for the World Cup.

Bravo, at 41 the oldest player in Copa America history, had eight saves in his 150th international appearance. He and Messi, former Barcelona teammates, spoke with each other while leading their teams onto the field for the national anthems.

“Losing this way leaves a bitter taste,” Bravo said. ""We played against a tremendous opponent.”

Organizers have the Herculean task of turning a football field into a concert venue and back in less than half an hour, and without damaging the playing surface.

Halftime at Sunday's 54th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs in Miami was headlined by Latina pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. It also featured surprise artists and other ensemble singers, said Dan Parise, a producer working with Roc Nation, the entertainment company producing the show with the National Football League.

PepsiCo is sponsoring the show for the eighth straight year. A source with direct knowledge of the show said it would cost about $13 million, a figure an NFL spokesperson declined to confirm.

“There are so many aspects of it, the dancers, the lighting elements, the special effects,” said Parise. “It's like a big jigsaw puzzle.”

The work starts almost a year in advance, said Mark Quenzel, the NFL's senior vice president for programming and production. Organizers scout the venue for logistical hurdles or unique structural elements they could use to their advantage.

In 2014, for example, producers had to keep Bruno Mars show relatively simple, because it was impossible to predict field conditions at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a rare outdoor cold weather Super Bowl.

This year, said Parise, a newly renovated overhang at Hard Rock Stadium allowed for deployment of more advanced audio equipment.

All in, the production takes 2,000 to 3,000 people to produce, said Quenzel, who is on his 10th halftime show.

Like past performances, this year's show will include an on-field audience of some 800 people, mostly kids from local schools who are cast in advance, and must rehearse with the artists.

Often, they are asked to play a larger role than that of cheering fans. During Justin Timberlake's 2018 rendition of Mirrors, the on-field crowd held up mirrors to reflect stadium lights.

The biggest feat of coordination is setting up the stage, which is wheeled in on 38 separate carts, each requiring 12 people to move. Another 18 carts, with 6-member teams, carry the audio equipment.

Like air traffic controllers, team leaders wearing headsets direct each team. A stage piece ending up in the wrong place, even by an inch or two, could be disastrous, Quenzel said.

The setup takes eight minutes, with the show itself lasting about 13. Removing the stage takes just over six minutes, Quenzel said, before the teams retake the field.

During the show, behind-the-scenes personnel wait in predetermined spots to carry away clothing during wardrobe changes that must be executed down to the second, Quenzel said. Part of the art of the show is what we don't show you, what you don't see, he said.

An example that stands out to Quenzel was in 2015, when pop star Katy Perry wanted to sing her hit, ‘Roar.’

She and the producers thought it would be fun if she entered riding a golden lion. The 6.1 metre mechanical beast was set on wheels concealed by legs that were pushed back and forth by performers to mimic footsteps.

For such a massive spectacle, there is precious little time to rehearse. Shakira and Lopez began separate rehearsals as early as December, Parise said, but had only a few days to practice together.

Rehearsals mostly took place at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, before moving to the Super Bowl stadium on Wednesday. We were working 12-to-15-hour days, Parise said.

Communication is another challenge. In addition to the hundreds of people hired by the NFL, each artist brings enormous teams of dancers and staff. To get everyone on the same page, producers hire veteran industry pros, including producer Ricky Kirshner and director Hamish Hamilton.

Sunday's show is said to feature plenty of special effects and dancing. But with all that goes into planning, it is important to remember the show is not the main event, Quenzel said.

“It's never lost on us that we're the side show,” he said.

https://www.thehindu.com/education/career-in-actuarial-science/article65203710.ece,Career in Actuarial Science,12-Mar-22,"As businesses and governments globally stepped up to adapt to a dynamically changing world, courtesy the pandemic, Actuarial Science began evolving to assume the new roles it now needs to play, as old functions became insufficient. More organisations have begun to rely on the skills of actuaries and analysts to model and plan for the future. Actuarial Science is slowly gaining popularity and recognition in India. A career in this field requires the use of Maths, statistical knowledge, risk assessment skills, and the evaluation of financial products such as insurance and investments. Risk-management skills provided by Actuarial Science can assist organisations in traversing and keeping up with the rapid changes in businesses.

According to IRDAI, the number of fully qualified insurance actuaries within India’s regulatory framework reached 458 last year compared to 439 in 2020. Many actuaries in India are qualified for practice outside of the Indian insurance market. They are now important in non-traditional roles like predicting the consequences of events such as climate change and pandemics such as
COVID-19, as well as in traditional roles such as devising and pricing appropriate products in a way that balances the interests of policyholders and insurance companies.

The process of becoming an actuary is linear, yet tough. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI ) oversees and regulates the education and training for domestic practice in India. The Society of Actuaries (SOA) provides education and research for actuaries practising in the large and growing offshore market in India. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) from the U.K. also provides education and research for actuaries in India. All these organisations have a rigorous education and exam process and maintain qualification through continuing professional development (CPD) and professionalism requirements.

Educational institutions in India have been closely watching the growing demand for actuaries, which is why many are now offering specialist actuarial degree programmes. Such recognised degree programmes are B.Sc. (Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance) and M.Sc. (Actuarial Science).

While historically, actuaries have often been associated with fields such as life, pensions and insurance, a growing number of professionals are now branching out into a newer variety of fields including but are not limited to health, banking and finance, technology, and climate change. An actuary’s role in each industry can be extremely different, ranging from product pricing, financial modelling, valuations, risk-management to carrying out peer reviews and designing social security schemes.

They can also serve as consultants for businesses, banks, financial consulting firms, actuarial consulting firms, the government sector, pension funds, investment advisories and can pursue academics as well.

The writer is Global Chief Actuary of MetLife and the immediate past President of the Society of Actuaries.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Protests-continue-against-Garner-verdict/article60321944.ece,Protests continue against Garner verdict,06-Dec-14,"Thousands of diverse people united by anger took to the streets from New York City to San Francisco for a second straight night to protest a grand jury clearing a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man.

Grandparents marched with their grandchildren. Experienced activists stood alongside newcomers, and protesters of all colours chanted slogans. “We’re under siege and it has to stop,” Harlem resident Judy Edwards, 61, said at a rally on Thursday night in lower Manhattan’s Foley Square.

That was the message, too, in cities across America — Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis Oakland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., among them. Sign-carrying, chanting demonstrators marched down heavily-travelled streets and shut down highways and bridges. Politicians talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.

In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio, blasted by police union leaders who accused him of not supporting his officers, outlined previously announced plans to teach officers how to communicate better with people on the street.

President Barack Obama also weighed in, saying one of the chief issues at stake is “making sure that people have confidence that police and law enforcement and prosecutors are serving everybody equally.”
