Here are the challenges it could face,"06 Mar, 2025, 09:27 PM IST","Reuters Top travel executives are expressing concerns that the United States may face difficulties in organising and hosting the 2026 World Cup unless significant improvements or adjustments are made quickly. World Cup 2026 is set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico City's famous Estadio Azteca will host the opening fixture. The United States' first match scheduled for the following day in Southern California. The tournament, which will see 48 teams participating, will conclude with the final on July 19, 2026 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Top travel executives' insights into World Cup 2026 US Travel Association president and CEO Geoff Freeman and MGM Resorts International president and CEO William Hornbuckle expressed their worries about whether the US travel system will be ready to manage the large number of foreign travellers expected to visit for the soccer event happening next summer, according to a CNN Sports report. Also Read : Bitcoin’s price soars again; experts suggest it could reach $1 million by year end Live Events World Cup 2026: What problems will the visitors face? The concerns cover a wide range of issues. Long wait times for fan visa approvals could discourage many people from trying to travel to the US for the tournament. Outdated technology and staff shortages might cause significant delays for visitors going through customs upon arrival. There are also concerns that security lines could become so long that they stretch outside airports. Furthermore, the absence of a dedicated interagency task force during the Donald Trump administration means that there has not been a well-coordinated federal response to address these various challenges. The report also cited Freeman stating that although the tournament is still over 15 months away, time is running out to address the list of concerns. Despite this, Geoff Freeman emphasised that he remains hopeful the administration can still take action and correct course to ensure the issues are resolved before the event. He also pointed out that more focus is needed on what it takes to make the event a success. If things continue at the current pace, there will be difficulties, but he believes it’s not too late to invest the necessary resources to tackle these challenges and ensure the tournament is the best World Cup ever. FIFA's plan on making World Cup 2026 a success A FIFA spokesperson told CNN that the organisation is working closely with the US government to ensure the tournament's success. They are confident that the Trump administration will take the necessary steps to make the event run smoothly for fans worldwide.

If the application is approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ), M Pallonji Group will hold a majority stake of 51%, with additional investments from Federal Bank and several family offices. The group's promoters, Mehli Mistry and Pheroze Mistry, are cousins of the Shapoorji Mistry family. Mehli Mistry also serves as a trustee on Tata Trusts. The group has appointed Aditya Sharma, chief distribution officer at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, as CEO of its proposed general insurance venture. The group did not respond to ET's request for comment, while Sehgal declined to comment. Sehgal is investing in his personal capacity, besides drawing firm commitments from a couple of other family offices. Live Events The venture, currently in the initial regulatory stages, will undergo IRDAI's R1, R2, and R3 approval process. The R1 stage evaluates business projections, board approvals, and financial commitments, while R2 defines share capital requirements. R3 is the final approval. The company is expected to launch with an initial investment of ₹200 crore, backed by six investors, according to one of the sources. M Pallonji Group has prior experience in the insurance sector as a long-term investor in PNB MetLife, where it holds nearly a 20% stake. The group intends to exit this investment only during an IPO. As of September 30, 2024, MetLife increased its stake in PNB MetLife to 48.91%, while PNB holds 30%. The remaining shares are divided among other investors, including M Pallonji Group. This marks a rare instance of an Indian conglomerate taking a majority stake in a general insurance venture, in contrast to recent entrants that have primarily been foreign investors or private equity firms. M Pallonji Group's businesses span various sectors, including painting, dredging, stevedoring, logistics, shipping, finance, investments, life insurance, automobile dealerships, and the manufacturing of speciality coatings. The general insurance industry has been growing in double digits over the past several years. In FY24, it expanded by 15.5% year-on-year, with the gross direct premium income (GDPI) reaching ₹2.79 lakh crore. ICRA projects the sector to grow by 32% to ₹3.7 lakh crore by FY26. Over the last decade, corporate-backed entrants in the insurance sector have been limited, with most recent approvals granted to private equity-led ventures such as GoDigit (backed by Fairfax) and Acko General Insurance. Kshema General Insurance, launched in recent years, focuses on crop insurance. IRDAI chairman Debasish Panda has emphasised the need for greater corporate participation to improve insurance penetration, which currently stands at just 1% of GDP. In the February budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the foreign direct investment cap in the insurance sector from 74% to 100% to support long-term capital inflows. The industry currently comprises 26 life insurers, 27 general insurers, seven standalone health insurers, one domestic reinsurer and 13 foreign reinsurers. It has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. In FY24, total premiums reached ₹11.23 lakh crore, with assets under management at ₹67.57 lakh crore. Insurance penetration was at 3.7%, and density at $95 - both significantly below the global averages of 7% and $889, respectively. (",article tag,ET,,"['Premium', 'IRDAI']",2

By asking “Aapka aage ka plan kya hai?” , the campaign encourages people to reflect on their aspirations and take proactive steps to secure their golden years.

We understand our customers’ aspirations, and ‘‘Aapka aage ka kya plan hai?” is their call to action. We’re here to help them plan for what’s next, from travel and new experiences to a financially secure retirement.” The campaign’s digital film brings this message to life through a conversation between two friends who, after a jog, sit on a park bench reflecting on life after retirement.

Bajaj Allianz Life MD and CEO Tarun Chugh said India's economic growth presents immense opportunities for the insurance sector to enhance financial resilience. ""Aligning tax deduction of life insurance annuity products with the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and addressing the issue of tax on principal component on annuity products can evolve retirement needs effectively,"" he added. Live Events Chugh also made a case for the introduction of a separate tax deduction for term insurance and extending the tax deduction on life insurance premiums under the new tax regime. According to the Annual Report of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), the country's insurance penetration in 2023-24 was 3.7 per cent compared to 4 per cent in 2022-23. The penetration for life insurance industry marginally declined from 3 per cent in 2022-23 to 2.8 per cent during 2023-24. The penetration with respect to the non-life insurance industry remained the same at 1 per cent during 2023-24. Subrata Mondal, MD and CEO of IFFCO Tokio General Insurance said the Union Budget provides an essential opportunity for the government to implement reforms that can address industry challenges and encourage the broader adoption of insurance products. One key expectation is the enhancement of tax incentives for policyholders to promote wider uptake of insurance, he added. Another priority is increasing budgetary support for government-backed insurance schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Ayushman Bharat, he added. ""They would significantly improve access to insurance for underserved populations, particularly in rural and economically weaker regions,"" Mondal said. Sameer Bansal, MD & CEO, PNB MetLife, said that while India is a fast-growing economy fuelled by its rising middle-class population of 25-45-year-olds, the proportion of people above the age of 60 is equally increasing at a rapid pace. Financial stability is a cornerstone of a secure future. One of our hopes for the upcoming budget is to see support for pension and annuity plans, which are key financial instruments for the retirement planning needed to create that stability, he added. ""Tax support for pension plans offered by life insurers on par with the National Pension Scheme will provide both greater choice and allow diversification of assets into multiple pension plans,"" he said. Bansal also urged the government to consider removing GST on premiums for annuity plans to support pensioners and make annuities more affordable and accessible. Universal Sompo General Insurance Managing Director and CEO Sharad Mathur opined that strengthening the insurance sector is essential for driving financial resilience, economic stability, and inclusive growth. With targeted reforms and incentives like the reduction of GST on Health insurance, we can unlock the true potential of insurance, ensuring wider coverage, encouraging innovation, and building a secure future for every individual and business, Mathur said. Srikanth Kandikonda, Chief Financial Officer, ManipalCigna Health Insurance, said that given the rising healthcare costs and the need for higher sum insured cover, the government should reduce the tax burden by increasing the limits under Section 80D of income tax for premiums paid for health insurance to Rs 50,000 for all and Rs 1 lakh for senior citizens. ""This is crucial for achieving the government's vision 'Insurance for all by 2047' and would substantially reduce the financial burden on families investing in their health and financial wellbeing,"" Kandikonda added. During 2023-24, the non-life insurance industry underwrote a total direct premium of Rs 2.90 lakh crore in India, registering a growth of 12.76 per cent from the previous year. There were 26 life insurers, 25 general insurers, eight standalone health insurers, 12 reinsurers and foreign reinsurance branches, and two specialised insurers, registered as of March 31, 2024.

Most of us buy a life insurance plan to financially safeguard our loved ones, in case of any unfortunate or unforeseen life events. A policyholder pays premiums regularly over a set time period, so that in case a family's main breadwinner passes away unexpectedly, the surviving dependents receive monetary assistance or payout from the insurer. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 However, buying a life insurance plan could all be in vain, if you your insurer does not honor the claims made by policyholders. How can you figure out if your life insurance company makes timely payouts on claims made by its policyholders? What percentage of the total claims received by the insurer during the year does it pay and how much is delayed? To understand how effective your life insurer is in claim settlement, you can take help of the claim settlement ratio . Insurance watchdog IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) annually releases a handbook of Indian Insurance Statistics detailing the claim settlement ratios of all life insurers in the country. What is a claim settlement ratio? Claim settlement ratio refers to the percentage of claims that an insurance company honors, or pays, out of the total claims that it receives during a particular period. For instance, if an insurer has a claim settlement ratio of 95% for a 30 days settlement, it means that the company likely honours 95 claims out of every 100 claims it receives from policyholders within 30 days of receiving the claim. Claim settlement ratio can help you gauge how likely it is that an insurer will honour, or pay you, if you make a claim. As a rule of thumb, a higher claim settlement ratio, i.e. closer to 100%, is positive, since it indicates that the insurer is trustworthy, and honours almost all claims made by policyholders in the shortest possible window of 30 days. Live Events In case an insurance company has a low claim settlement ratio, it reflects that the company potentially has a track record of either delaying the claim or at worst denying claims. Note that while claim settlement ratio is an important metric, it should not be the sole factor on which you decide your life insurer. You should also consider other factors like coverage offered and premium payable before taking a final call. Latest claim settlement ratio of life insurers in 2025, per IRDAI IRDAI recently released a list of the claim settlement ratios of all life insurers in the country, as of 2023-2024. During this period, the claim settlement ratio of the entire life insurance industry, which includes private players and LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) stood at 96.82% for claims settled within a 30-day period. This implies that India’s life insurers honoured 96.82% of the total individual death claim requests received by them in FY2023-24 within 30 days of receiving the claim. On the other hand, India’s private life insurers were able to honour around 99% of all the individual death claim requests within 30 days of claims that were presented to them in FY 2023-24. Claims that have been honored and settled within 30 days from intimation are considered most effective. What is claim settlement ratio by number? Number here refers to the number of life insurance policies sold by each life insurer during the year. According to data, certain life insurers such as Kotak Mahindra, Ageas Federal, Future Generali and Aviva emerged with 100% claim settlement ratios, which means that they were able to honour individual death claims on all their policies within 30 days of receiving the claim. Amongst bigger insurers, Axis Max Life Insurance emerged with a 99.79% claim settlement ratio. HDFC had a claim settlement ratio of 99.97%, settling about 19333 policies within a span of 30 days. In terms of most number of policies settled within 30 days, LIC took lead with 7,99,612 policies settled in less than 30 days. Claim settlement ratios of life insurers in 2025 in individual category (in terms of number of policies) Insurance Company Total Number of Policies in 2023-2024 No. of policies where claim was paid within 30 days % of claims paid within 30 days to total claims (In %) LIC 829318 799612 96.42 SBI LIFE 37724 37344 98.99 AXIS MAX LIFE 19569 19529 99.79 HDFC 19338 19333 99.97 BAJAJ ALLIANZ 14695 14662 99.78 ICICI PRUDENTIAL 13411 12997 97.09 RELIANCE NIPPON 8072 7631 94.54 TATA AIA 6375 6348 99.58 ADITYA BIRLA SUNLIFE 6203 6201 99.97 PNB METLIFE 5679 5664 99.74 KOTAK MAHINDRA 4300 4300 100 SHRIRAM 3799 3752 98.76 INDIAFIRST 3300 3298 99.94 CANARA HSBC 2444 2444 100 BHARTI AXA 1996 1996 100 STAR UNION 1958 1848 94.38 AGEAS FEDERAL 1182 1182 100 FUTURE GENERALI 931 931 100 AVIVA 775 775 100 PRAMERICA 734 723 98.5 EDELWEISS LIFE 518 518 100 BANDHAN 294 294 100 PRIVATE SECTOR TOTAL 153297 151770 99 GRAND TOTAL (LIC+ PRIVATE) 982615 951382 96.82 Source: Handbook on Indian Insurance Statistics 2023-24, IRDAI All data for 2023-24 Note: 1. “Life insurance business of Sahara India Life Insurance Company Ltd (SILIC) is transferred to SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd (SBI Life) by IRDAI vide its Order dt. 2.6.2023 and the above data / information for the FY 2023-24 does not include data / information pertaining to SILIC"". What is claim settlement ratio by benefit amount? Honoring a claim is not the only parameter prospective policyholders should look for in a life insurer. You should also check how much percentage of the total amount collected by the company is ultimately paid out in claim settlement. A higher claim settlement ratio (by benefit amount) means that the company is paying out a higher proportion of the total claims it has collected during the year. This is a positive sign, since it reflects the company’s will to offer fair settlement. If a company has a low claim settlement ratio, it simply implies that it is delaying making payouts, or completely denying claims presented to it. Again, benefit amount paid within 30 days of claim intimation is considered most timely and effective. Both these claim settlement ratios must be looked at in conjunction so that policyholders get a sense of how financially strong their life insurer is. Claim settlement ratio of life insurance companies 2025 in individual category (in terms of benefit amount) Insurance Company Total benefit amount paid in 2023-2024 Total claim benefit amount paid within 30 days % of claim benefit amount paid within 30 days to total benefit amount LIC 17862.87 17011.43 95.23 SBI LIFE 1948.91 1920.34 98.53 ICICI PRUDENTIAL 1866.88 1701.91 91.16 HDFC 1584 1583.61 99.98 AXIS MAX LIFE 1254.38 1254.05 99.97 TATA AIA 1086.15 1079.43 99.38 BAJAJ ALLIANZ 615.18 607.39 98.73 ADITYA BIRLA SUNLIFE 496.52 496.26 99.95 PNB METLIFE 462.19 460.92 99.72 KOTAK MAHINDRA 335.71 335.69 99.99 RELIANCE NIPPON 212.53 176.26 82.94 CANARA HSBC 206.93 206.93 100 INDIAFIRST 178.3 177.71 99.67 BHARTI AXA 137.62 137.62 100 STAR UNION 120.71 105.37 87.29 SHRIRAM 116.36 114.19 98.14 AVIVA 105.24 105.24 100 BANDHAN 79.92 79.92 100 AGEAS FEDERAL 66.65 66.65 100 EDELWEISS LIFE 62.91 62.91 100 FUTURE GENERALI 36.14 36.14 100 PRAMERICA 31.49 30.35 96.39 PRIVATE SECTOR TOTAL 11004.72 10738.9 97.58 GRAND TOTAL 28867.59 27750.33 96.13 Source: Handbook on Indian Insurance Statistics 2023-24, IRDAI All data for 2023-24 Note: 1. “Life insurance business of Sahara India Life Insurance Company Ltd (SILIC) is transferred to SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd (SBI Life) by IRDAI vide its Order dt. 2.6.2023 and the above data / information for the FY 2023-24 does not include data / information pertaining to SILIC"".

Which cities are emerging? Naukri shares that emerging cities like Indore, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar, and Jaipur are witnessing impressive growth. Udaipur saw a 17% growth overall in 2024, while Indore was up by 14%. In 2024, Odisha experienced a 22% growth, and both Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan saw an 18% growth each. These cities are emerging as key growth hubs in India. Sarbojit Mallick, co-founder, Instahyre shares during and post pandemic there was a reverse migration of talent to their hometowns. As time has passed, a significant percentage of this talent chose to stay instead of returning to established (but costly) tech hubs like Bengaluru or NCR. This has resulted in smaller cities emerging as tech hubs with great potential to accelerate India's growth as a tech-forward nation. For example, cities like Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, Pune [already a major tech hub], and Mangalore and Coimbatore down south are well-established due to major IT firms taking first steps in sourcing talent from them, like Infosys [Mysuru], Wipro [Coimbatore], MetLife [Jaipur]. Live Events How is job recruitment evolving in these cities? Naukri shares that overall, there is an increasing demand for roles in digital marketing, marketing, and design. The Sales & Marketing department saw a 7% growth in December 2024, with significant increases in positions such as Campaign Manager (20% increase), Direct Marketing (8% increase), and Marketing Leadership (6% increase), reflecting the strengthening of marketing functions. Non-metro cities like Jaipur (2902 job postings), Kochi (2150 postings), Coimbatore (1917 postings) are seeing a surge in job postings, indicating a rise in recruitment activities even outside of metro areas. Mallick adds that availability of jobs within their hometowns has reduced talent attrition - a major pain point for recruiters in the tech domain. Some more emerging hubs are Bhopal, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Guwahati, Vizag, Ranchi, Hubbali, Tiruchirapalli, Lucknow, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Madurai, and Vellore. Aiding in GCC growth: Nitin Barekere, VP - HR, Omega Healthcare agrees, sharing that while Bangalore and Hyderabad have become destinations for many of the Fortune 500 Companies in setting-up their GCC and Developmental centres, other cities like Pune, Coimbatore, Indore, Bhubaneswar, and Chandigarh are emerging as notable tech hubs in India. He adds that these cities combine a strong educational ecosystem, a growing pool of skilled talent, and supportive government policies aimed at promoting technology-driven growth. Pune & Coimbatore are gaining prominence due to their thriving startup culture, excellent engineering colleges, and growing IT infrastructure. Indore has positioned itself as a tech hub with its cost-effective real estate and a workforce that is increasingly skilled in digital technologies. Bhubaneswar, recognized as a ""Smart City,"" is leveraging government initiatives and a focus on IT parks to attract major companies. Similarly, Chandigarh benefits from its proximity to educational institutions and an improving tech ecosystem. Factors such as access to talent pool, lower operational costs, better work-life balance, regional & global connectivity, and growing infrastructure make these cities attractive for companies and employees alike. Moreover, the rise of hybrid work models allows organizations to tap into regional talent pools, further driving the development of these aspirational tech hubs. Mallick agrees, quotes a report by Deloitte-Nasscom that projects the GCC market to reach $100 billion by 2030, employing over 2.5 million Indians. Bengaluru, NCR, Mumbai and Hyderabad are grappling with strained infrastructure and spiraling costs. In this scenario, the rise of the smaller city is a practical outcome which will stand India in good stead to compete on a global level. The support given to today's entrepreneurs might give birth to home-grown tech giants beyond ITES. ( Originally published on Jan 23, 2025 )",article tag,ET,,[],0

The fresh issue of shares is part of a process to induct the state-owned Punjab National Bank into the life insurer. The regulator has cleared the proposal, but with riders. Irda, after a detailed examination, found that certain regulatory issues do not allow some of the existing shareholders to subscribe to the fresh issue and asked them not to subscribe to it.

Allowing 100% FDI in insurance may not only open the floodgates for offshore capital to enter India but also facilitate the entry of new foreign insurers, helping the country enhance insurance penetration to achieve the government’s goal of “Insurance for all by 2047”. There are 26 life and 32 general insurers in India, with most private sector players operating through a joint venture with a foreign partner. “When we talk about insurance for all by 2047, it really means every individual has at least a health policy, a life insurance policy, and a property policy that covers his home and his business. Most recently there is a proposal from the government to increase FDI insurance to 100%. Irdai is working on it,” Sood said. The regulator increased the FDI limit in insurance from 49% to 74% in 2021. The plan to raise it further aligns with its goal to widen the reach of insurance so every Indian citizen in the country is covered by some type of insurance by 2047. “Irdai is working on increasing the number of players in the country so that there is a deeper penetration and we can expect more and more coverage,” said Sood. The Irdai member added that the government could help enhance insurance coverage in the country by incentivizing offering tax benefits or subsidies.

At the Mint BFSI Summit, Sood urged the insurance industry to rethink their distribution models to ensure a deeper market penetration, as well as to develop new products to address different needs and risks. Over the past two years, Irdai has reformed the product use and file process to encourage innovation in the insurance industry, he said, adding that a key innovation to enhance insurance penetration without increasing mis-selling was Irdai’s introduction of the “consumer information sheet”. “This document gives in very simple terms the coverage (and) the key points of the insurance policy that make the policyholder aware of what he is going to buy,” Sood said. “There are always a lot of grievances that the customer doesn’t know what he is buying since the details are in the fine print. This is specifically in that direction to address the issue and make clear to the customer what insurance he is buying.” Another key initiative is Bima Sugam—“an electronic insurance marketplace which aims at bringing all stakeholders in the value chain on one platform”. Sood said Bima Sugam was launched to align with the regulator’s ambition to increase efficiency, improve transparency, make more products available, enhance services, deepen penetration, and make claims settlement easier to get India closer to insurance for all by 2047.

The insurance regulator has made cashless settlements, pre-authorization within one hour of request, and discharge of post-authorization duties within three hours of claim mandatory. “There are penalties if the insurer fails to adhere to these norms. These measures are meant to make the claim process easy in health insurance. It is supported by a robust grievance handling mechanism,” said Sood. He added that while government schemes have covered a vast lower-income population and people with high income are able to afford insurance, the industry was missing out on the mass in the middle. “We have to work towards bringing a new approach, customised products, and developing new methodologies for distribution across new types of groups and do whatever it takes to address this missing middle-income group. Otherwise, a vast population remains without health insurance coverage,” said Sood. Also read | Insurers may get to sell related non-insurance value added products and services but not MFs Sood also highlighted the need for more domestic reinsurers amid emerging geopolitical risks and increasing natural disasters. “... there is decreasing capacity in the reinsurance market. We need to work on ways to increase domestic capacity, which can be brought about by the introduction of new players,” he said. Sood added that the industry needed to rethink ways to handle the “increasing number and severity of natural catastrophic events”. “We need to build capacity and new kinds of parametric products, which will make it easier for people to not only take insurance against these perils but also to be able to claim when such natural catastrophes strike,” Sood said. “We need to expand reinsurance capacity in this market so that we are able to handle more and more such events and be self-reliant.” Also read | A tech solution to crop insurance woes? Sood added that Irdai was working towards introducing a risk-based capital regime. “This will benefit both insurers and the market and assign capital to the appropriate risk. As we see more and more complex risks coming in, insurers will be able to better utilize and manage their capital.” He also urged insurers in India to work on better ways to deal with cyber risks. “The worst thing about cyber risk is it is not known where does it start and where does it attack,” said Sood. “We are carrying devices in our pockets and that is the way we are exposing ourselves to these risks. We have to develop methods to safeguard against these kind of risks.” With the evolution of quantum computing the face of such risk will again change “and it will be upon us in a much more complex way”, the Irdai member said. “We need to build measures to protect each individual, and if you are struck by it you see that you are protected through insurance.” Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Early onset of heart-related disease among Indians may lead to higher treatment costs, including medications and hospitalisation, which can be covered under comprehensive health insurance. However, claims related to the treatment of heart disease are often rejected due to certain factors. On World Heart Day 2024, let's understand the key reasons for rejecting health insurance claims related to heart ailments. Several factors, including non-disclosure of pre-existing disease (PED), waiting period, exclusion of specific treatments, etc., can lead to the rejection of health insurance claims, especially those related to heart disease treatments. Learn about the key reasons from health industry experts. Manish Dodeja, Head of Claims & Underwriting, Care Health Insurance, warned that it is always advisable for people to disclose their health conditions when taking health insurance. Failure to do so may lead to rejection of claims in the future. Conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood sugar levels, if not disclosed at the time of taking health insurance, may become a reason for health insurance claim rejection. “We have seen cases of non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions. For example, if somebody has been suffering from a heart condition or had a medical history related to the heart or any other condition that has not been disclosed to the insurance company. In that scenario, the insurance company may reject the claim, citing non-disclosure,” said Siddharth Singhal, Business Head of Health Insurance at Policybazaar.com. “Health Insurance policies have a waiting period for specific diseases, including those cardiovascular conditions. Claims made before the completion of this waiting period are rejected,” said Dodeja. Singhal explained the claim rejection cases due to waiting periods with an example: “If a person declares that he has a heart condition, then the insurance company would initially put a waiting period of three years. If the person claims for a heart disease treatment within three years, the insurance company obviously does not consider the claim favourable.”  He also advised people with a medical history to carefully consider the waiting period before taking insurance and consider the option of reducing the waiting period by remarkable riders available with several health insurance providers. A few medications and treatments fall out of the ambit of health insurance coverage. “Some health insurances may not cover certain specified procedures, medication. A thorough understanding of such exclusion is critical before purchasing a policy,” said Dodeja. Most heart disease treatments are covered by standard health insurance, but some expensive and rare treatments can be excluded from certain schemes.  Experts have underlined a few points to avoid claim rejection related to heart disease treatment: Complete disclosure of health conditions, knowledge of policy coverage, proper understanding of the waiting period, opting for specialised health insurance, preferring network hospitals for treatment, etc. “If your Health Insurance claim is rejected, the first step is to carefully review the rejection letter to understand the reason behind the denial, which could be due to missing documentation or policy-related issues. Once you have the clarity, you can appeal to your insurer, providing the additional documentation or correcting errors in your submission, in case that is the reason for rejection,” said Manish Dodeja. “If policyholders are unhappy even after contacting insurers,they can approach theInsurance Ombudsman. If insurers are still unsatisfied with the claim,they can also take the matter to court,” noted Singhal.

Concurrently, the Annual Report of IRDAI for FY23-24 underscored substantial challenges in the insurance sector. Notably, over two lakh complaints were lodged via the centralised grievance portal, with a significant portion targeting life insurers for unfair business practices, excluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India. ""Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of a few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. Prompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary to increase insurance penetration. Acknowledging misselling and misrepresentation and compensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, fund management, banking and insurance firms,"" the document noted. Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates The Union government tabled the Economic Survey 2023-24 in Parliament. The Economic Survey document, prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and formulated under the supervision of the chief economic adviser, gives insights into the state of the economy and various indicators of 2023-24 (April-March) and some outlook for the current year.  With this upcoming budget presentation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's upcoming budget speech will be her seventh. “We commend the IRDAI's initiatives to prioritize the wellbeing of policyholders, from implementing cashless systems to emphasizing Ombudsman schemes, ensuring policyholders' interests are safeguarded. However, with increasing climate change and economic development-related risks, there is a pressing need to protect against unforeseen disruptions. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritizing risk management and protection. We recommend that the government consider the following measures: •Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to INR 75,000. •Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs). •Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches. •Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class.

Here’s how an unlimited sum-insured health plan can help you,2 min read.06 Jul 2024,"Comprehensive health insurance provides a much-needed shield from critical illnesses and unprecedented health emergencies. In contrast to a higher sum insured amount, which provides a cushion to expensive treatment, a health plan with an unlimited sum insured amount eliminates the concern of exhausting the claim limit during treatment. Currently, there are fewer options for health insurance plans with unlimited sum insured features. However, they can act as saviour in terms of critical illnesses and other ailments requiring advanced treatment. Here’s all you need to know about unlimited sum insured plans. The sum insured by a health insurance plan is the maximum amount a person can avail for healthcare treatment. As the name suggests, an unlimited sum insured plan provides unlimited coverage to customers for healthcare treatment. Generally, health insurance plans come with a sum insured amount of  ₹5 lakh,  ₹25 lakh,  ₹1 crore, and more. However, there is no capping on the amount under unlimited sum insured plans. This feature empowers customers to avail of healthcare treatment without worrying about cost. An unlimited sum insured plan is helpful for people with pre-existing diseases or those at risk of age-related disease, according to Siddharth Singhal - Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. “People are often confused when choosing sum insured because you never know when a medical emergency might hit you. Covid, for instance, nobody could’ve imagined it, but it wreaked havoc on people’s lifetime savings. In such cases, it’s best to go with an unlimited sum insured,” said Singhal. By opting for this plan, a person can claim their health insurance unlimited times in a year with no upper limit for the claim amount. However, the situation varies according to the plan. Recently, ICICI Lombard launched a health insurance product, ‘Elevate’, which provides unlimited sum insured to policyholders. People can opt for this feature as an add-on service or as a critical feature of their policy. Bajaj Allianze’s Health Infinity Plan provides unlimited coverage. Customers can also avail themselves of wellness discounts, family discounts, and other benefits. The Unlimited Acko Platinum Plan also comes with an unlimited sum insured feature, allowing people to claim unlimited coverage for their health care treatment. Other key features of the plan include a zero-waiting period for pre-existing disease (PED) and 100% hospitalisation bill payment. Health insurance plans with an unlimited sum insured come with higher premiums than plans with a fixed sum insured amount. “The unlimited health insurance plan costs between  ₹15,000 and  ₹20,000. If a person chooses a plan with a  ₹10 lakh sum insured and above and adds a rider for unlimited coverage, it’ll cost them about  ₹7,000— ₹8,000 + 10% for the rider,” explained Singhal.

Here’s when you can get a full refund from the airline,2 min read.14 Mar 2024,"Let’s assume you are on a vacation with a full-planned itinerary. You are set to return home on a certain date, but due to some unavoidable reasons, you now need to return earlier. LiveMint talked to experts to understand under what circumstances a person who has taken travel insurance would be allowed to get a full refund of their return tickets. According to Manas Kapoor, business head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com, travellers can get a full refund in the case of a medical emergency. This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies. Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the Supreme Court of India, added, “The definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.” Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, “but majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.” Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund. “In such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,” said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors. Kapoor explained that these documents may include proofs like admission to a hospital and a doctor’s advice on returning. According to Bajaj, there are some other cases when an airline may have to fully refund a traveller. “In cases where the airline cancels a flight due to bad weather, mechanical issues, or staffing problems or if there is a significant rescheduling in the flight timings, the passengers are entitled to get a full refund regardless of the reason for cancellation,” Bajaj said. However, in these cases, according to the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), an airline is bound to provide a traveller with an alternative at no additional cost. If one does not accept it, they are not bound to get any compensation. “One is not entitled to any compensation or refund in case you don’t accept alternative travel arrangements or if the cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, like any force majeure events like civil war, natural disasters, security risks, government regulations etc,” said Sneha Bhogle Kale, partner at Accord Juris LLP.

Reproductive Health Services: expanded insurance coverage that includes reproductive health services such as contraception, fertility treatments, and reproductive surgeries can empower women to make informed decisions about their health and family planning, improving female mortality and India’s sex ratio which stands at about 929:1000(female:male ratio) Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in Indian women, and survival rates post 5 years of incidence are just 66%, amongst the lowest in the world. Tailored insurance plans can offer coverage for breast cancer screening, diagnostic tests, treatments, and post-treatment care to ensure early detection and effective management of the disease. Gender-specific Illnesses Coverage: Insurance policies include coverage for gender-specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometriosis, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. Women-specific Health Check-ups: Insurance policies can include coverage for regular health check-ups, preventive screenings, and wellness programs tailored to women's health needs. Critical Illness Coverage: Comprehensive coverage for critical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes can ensure access to advanced medical treatments and ongoing care for women facing serious health challenges. The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2021-22 highlights that the Female labour force participation (FLFPR) rate in India for the working age group (15 years & above) has increased considerably to 32.8%, still well below the global average of 47 percent for several years. Boosting women's entrepreneurship: Insurance schemes can support women entrepreneurs by providing packaged coverage for businesses, business interruption coverage plans, and fostering entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. Income Protection: Income protection plans specifically designed for women can provide financial support in case of career breaks due to childbirth, caregiving responsibilities, or health issues. Childcare Support: Insurance plans may offer childcare benefits to help working mothers cover the costs of childcare services, enabling them to balance work and family responsibilities effectively. By incorporating these various coverage into insurance policies, insurers would effectively address the specific needs and priorities of women, promoting gender equality, financial inclusion, and overall well-being.

Hence, it is important to be financially prepared for such fatal diseases with health coverage. Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance. Also Read: Focus on essential features when choosing health insurance, says Vivek Chaturvedi By 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022. On World Cancer Day, know about the insurance options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses. Also Read: The Role of Cancer Insurance in Cancer Prevention and Early Detection A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment. Also Read: 9.3 lakh lives lost to cancer in India, urging the need for comprehensive health insurance There is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer. “A cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,” explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal. One of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc. Also Read: Here’s why doctors should consider professional indemnity insurance “A critical illness cover acts as a top–up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,” noted Singhal. A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it “offers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions”. However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed. “A cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,” Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint. Sum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to  ₹30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of  ₹50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal. Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. “Hence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,” said Singhal. In addition to this, it is equally important to compare and analyse various cancer coverage plans online for an informed decision. Moreover, it is a must to have a better understanding of the exclusions in the policy. Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Details here,1 min read.02 Feb 2024,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has recently issued directions to all insurance companies telling them to cover AYUSH treatment just as other treatments. AYUSH refers to the treatment given under alternative therapies of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. The latest move stems from the growing prevalence of these treatments, because of which the regulator felt the need to consider these treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of health insurance. The IRDAI circular says, “the insurance companies will have a board approved policy for providing AYUSH coverage which will include their approach towards placing AYUSH treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of health insurance so as to provide an option for the policyholders to choose treatment of their choice.” “The policy will also contain the quality parameters as well as procedure for enrolling AYUSH hospitals/ day care centres as network providers for the purpose of providing cashless facilities,” the circular adds. The circular further says that the insurers will have adequate controls as well as standard operating procedures for a number of activities which include the following: 1. Enrolling hospitals into their network. 2 Placing necessary clauses in their health services agreements with Ayush hospitals/ day care centres. 3. Standard treatment protocols, and 4. Dealing with the possible frauds and abuse of the system, if any For this purpose, the Ministry of Ayush on Oct 4, 2023 constituted a ‘Core Group of Experts for Insurance Sector’. The insurance companies are told to actively engage with this group in order to develop required modalities for providing Ayush coverage. The directions issued on Jan 31 will come into effect from April 1, 2024. Meanwhile, in another news IRDAI chief flagged the concern of high premium and highlighted the need for individual risk profiling. IRDAI Chief Debasish Panda said data analytics should ensure that premiums take into account the individual risk and not the average risk of the group. “There is a need to build an ecosystem where premiums are no longer one-size-fits all but are customised to individual risk profiling,” he said.

Early onset of heart-related disease among Indians may lead to higher treatment costs, including medications and hospitalisation, which can be covered under comprehensive health insurance. However, claims related to the treatment of heart disease are often rejected due to certain factors. On World Heart Day 2024, let's understand the key reasons for rejecting health insurance claims related to heart ailments. Several factors, including non-disclosure of pre-existing disease (PED), waiting period, exclusion of specific treatments, etc., can lead to the rejection of health insurance claims, especially those related to heart disease treatments. Learn about the key reasons from health industry experts. Manish Dodeja, Head of Claims & Underwriting, Care Health Insurance, warned that it is always advisable for people to disclose their health conditions when taking health insurance. Failure to do so may lead to rejection of claims in the future. Conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood sugar levels, if not disclosed at the time of taking health insurance, may become a reason for health insurance claim rejection. “We have seen cases of non-disclosure of pre-existing conditions. For example, if somebody has been suffering from a heart condition or had a medical history related to the heart or any other condition that has not been disclosed to the insurance company. In that scenario, the insurance company may reject the claim, citing non-disclosure,” said Siddharth Singhal, Business Head of Health Insurance at Policybazaar.com. “Health Insurance policies have a waiting period for specific diseases, including those cardiovascular conditions. Claims made before the completion of this waiting period are rejected,” said Dodeja. Singhal explained the claim rejection cases due to waiting periods with an example: “If a person declares that he has a heart condition, then the insurance company would initially put a waiting period of three years. If the person claims for a heart disease treatment within three years, the insurance company obviously does not consider the claim favourable.”  He also advised people with a medical history to carefully consider the waiting period before taking insurance and consider the option of reducing the waiting period by remarkable riders available with several health insurance providers. A few medications and treatments fall out of the ambit of health insurance coverage. “Some health insurances may not cover certain specified procedures, medication. A thorough understanding of such exclusion is critical before purchasing a policy,” said Dodeja. Most heart disease treatments are covered by standard health insurance, but some expensive and rare treatments can be excluded from certain schemes.  Experts have underlined a few points to avoid claim rejection related to heart disease treatment: Complete disclosure of health conditions, knowledge of policy coverage, proper understanding of the waiting period, opting for specialised health insurance, preferring network hospitals for treatment, etc. “If your Health Insurance claim is rejected, the first step is to carefully review the rejection letter to understand the reason behind the denial, which could be due to missing documentation or policy-related issues. Once you have the clarity, you can appeal to your insurer, providing the additional documentation or correcting errors in your submission, in case that is the reason for rejection,” said Manish Dodeja. “If policyholders are unhappy even after contacting insurers,they can approach theInsurance Ombudsman. If insurers are still unsatisfied with the claim,they can also take the matter to court,” noted Singhal.

Hold on! Major relief may be coming for policyholders. Details here,2 min read.08 Sep 2024,"The 54th Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, scheduled for September 9, 2024, in New Delhi, may discuss the possibility of removing the 18 percent GST on term life insurance premiums, according to multiple media reports. Various stakeholders in the insurance sector have long advocated for this removal. Industry experts believe enacting this decision, i.e., eliminating this tax, would significantly alleviate the financial burden on insurance customers. The 18 percent GST on life and health insurance premiums has long been contentious, with many stakeholders pushing for its removal. “Multiple stakeholders, including sitting ministers, have requested to exempt GST on term and health insurance. Likely, the GST Council may favourably consider this industry demand, especially if the revenue loss due to the grant of such exemption is not major. However, to allow the full effect of exemption from GST to be passed on to the public at large, the insurance companies would also need to be allowed full input tax credit without requiring a reversal of credit due to exemption from GST on term insurance,” said Sandeep Pareek, Partner, Indirect Tax, BDO India. Currently, the 18 percent GST on term life insurance premiums adds to the cost of insurance. “Term life insurance is essentially an insurance that acts as a safeguard to guarantee that families are protected in the case of the policy holder’s death. Whenever the government applies such high taxation rates on such premiums, it dissuades individuals from taking risks by opting for this necessary shield. Further lowering or complete elimination of GST may cause the enhanced purchase of term life insurance, which is still in its infancy in the country,” said Siddharth Maurya, Founder and Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited. Sandeep Pareek highlights that exempting GST from term insurance products could significantly promote these plans by making them more affordable for the public. Siddharth Maurya adds, “Reducing or removing GST on term insurance premiums could encourage more people to secure their families' futures without additional financial burden. This would also expand the insurance coverage base, fostering industry growth.” Maurya also believes such a decision could transform India’s insurance sector. “It would demonstrate the regulator's commitment to making life insurance more accessible and effective as a risk management tool. We anticipate the GST Council will adopt a forward-thinking approach that benefits millions of Indians.” Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to eliminate the GST on health and life insurance premiums. In a letter dated August 24, O'Brien stated, “The 18% GST on health and life insurance premiums places an undue strain on many, affecting their access to crucial financial protection in times of illness, accidents, or untimely death. Our shared responsibility is to ensure that this vital safety net remains affordable for all segments of society.” The GST Council, which includes the Union Finance Minister and representatives from all States and Union Territories, was created to oversee decisions on various GST matters, such as tax rates, exemptions, and administrative procedures. It has been instrumental in shaping India's GST framework. Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, and not of Mint.

Concurrently, the Annual Report of IRDAI for FY23-24 underscored substantial challenges in the insurance sector. Notably, over two lakh complaints were lodged via the centralised grievance portal, with a significant portion targeting life insurers for unfair business practices, excluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India. ""Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of a few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. Prompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary to increase insurance penetration. Acknowledging misselling and misrepresentation and compensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, fund management, banking and insurance firms,"" the document noted. Economic Survey 2024 Live Updates The Union government tabled the Economic Survey 2023-24 in Parliament. The Economic Survey document, prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and formulated under the supervision of the chief economic adviser, gives insights into the state of the economy and various indicators of 2023-24 (April-March) and some outlook for the current year.  With this upcoming budget presentation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's upcoming budget speech will be her seventh. “We commend the IRDAI's initiatives to prioritize the wellbeing of policyholders, from implementing cashless systems to emphasizing Ombudsman schemes, ensuring policyholders' interests are safeguarded. However, with increasing climate change and economic development-related risks, there is a pressing need to protect against unforeseen disruptions. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritizing risk management and protection. We recommend that the government consider the following measures: •Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to INR 75,000. •Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs). •Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches. •Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class.  Implementing these measures will not only create a more resilient and sustainable economic environment but also pave the way for a healthier and greener future, fostering a sense of optimism and progress.” Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Here’s how an unlimited sum-insured health plan can help you,2 min read.06 Jul 2024,"Comprehensive health insurance provides a much-needed shield from critical illnesses and unprecedented health emergencies. In contrast to a higher sum insured amount, which provides a cushion to expensive treatment, a health plan with an unlimited sum insured amount eliminates the concern of exhausting the claim limit during treatment. Currently, there are fewer options for health insurance plans with unlimited sum insured features. However, they can act as saviour in terms of critical illnesses and other ailments requiring advanced treatment. Here’s all you need to know about unlimited sum insured plans. The sum insured by a health insurance plan is the maximum amount a person can avail for healthcare treatment. As the name suggests, an unlimited sum insured plan provides unlimited coverage to customers for healthcare treatment. Generally, health insurance plans come with a sum insured amount of  ₹5 lakh,  ₹25 lakh,  ₹1 crore, and more. However, there is no capping on the amount under unlimited sum insured plans. This feature empowers customers to avail of healthcare treatment without worrying about cost. An unlimited sum insured plan is helpful for people with pre-existing diseases or those at risk of age-related disease, according to Siddharth Singhal - Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. “People are often confused when choosing sum insured because you never know when a medical emergency might hit you. Covid, for instance, nobody could’ve imagined it, but it wreaked havoc on people’s lifetime savings. In such cases, it’s best to go with an unlimited sum insured,” said Singhal. By opting for this plan, a person can claim their health insurance unlimited times in a year with no upper limit for the claim amount. However, the situation varies according to the plan. Recently, ICICI Lombard launched a health insurance product, ‘Elevate’, which provides unlimited sum insured to policyholders. People can opt for this feature as an add-on service or as a critical feature of their policy. Bajaj Allianze’s Health Infinity Plan provides unlimited coverage. Customers can also avail themselves of wellness discounts, family discounts, and other benefits. The Unlimited Acko Platinum Plan also comes with an unlimited sum insured feature, allowing people to claim unlimited coverage for their health care treatment. Other key features of the plan include a zero-waiting period for pre-existing disease (PED) and 100% hospitalisation bill payment. Health insurance plans with an unlimited sum insured come with higher premiums than plans with a fixed sum insured amount. “The unlimited health insurance plan costs between  ₹15,000 and  ₹20,000. If a person chooses a plan with a  ₹10 lakh sum insured and above and adds a rider for unlimited coverage, it’ll cost them about  ₹7,000— ₹8,000 + 10% for the rider,” explained Singhal.

Know from experts,3 min read.28 Jun 2024,"National Insurance Awareness Day 2024: The low insurance penetration in India is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of millions of Indians to financial burden and crisis in case of untoward incidents like terminal illness, accident, etc. National Insurance Awareness Day, observed every year on June 28, is an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of taking insurance. From early adulthood to retirement, the right insurance helps a person secure the future of himself and his family. According to Casparus Kromhout MD & CEO of Shriram Life Insurance, insurance is crucial not only for personal coverage but also to safeguarding a person's valuable assets like home, car, and business from damage, theft, or liabilities. “Many insurance products offer tax benefits and can even be used as investment tools. This means that while you're enjoying the protection insurance provides, you can also grow your wealth and make your money work for you,” said Casparus Kromhout. Insurance awareness is crucial for financial security because of the unfortunate COVID-19, there has been a substantial improvement in awareness. Despite understanding the importance of insurance, people tend to postpone purchasing a policy, often due to misconceptions about the costs or a belief that they can delay it without consequence. This procrastination is a significant reason why insurance penetration rates remain low in India, even though literacy rates are rising. It's essential to not only be aware of insurance but also to recognize its immediate necessity to truly secure one's financial future. Contrary to popular belief, life insurance doesn't have to be expensive. Premiums can be adjusted to fit different budgets, and options like term insurance offer substantial coverage at affordable rates. You can buy policies for yourself, your spouse, or even your children. Joint policies and child plans provide comprehensive coverage for your loved ones too. “India, being one of the fastest-growing insurance markets, still has a relatively low insurance penetration rate of 4% of its GDP, leaving a sizable gap. This gap is largely due to a lack of awareness and accessibility of insurance and its critical role in financial stability during unforeseen incidents. On this National Insurance Awareness Day, the industry must spread awareness and work towards closing this gap,"" said Dhirendra Mahyavanshi, Co-founder and CEO of Turtlemint. “Being aware about insurance options and regularly reviewing policies are key steps in achieving comprehensive financial security.Adequate insurance coverage protects against unforeseen events, reducing the financial burden caused by accidents, illnesses, natural disasters, or other unexpected circumstances. By keeping updated for various insurance options and encouraging regular policy reviews, individuals can ensure they are adequately protected, thereby safeguarding their financial stability and peace of mind,” said Shashi Kant Dahuja Chief Underwriting Officer, Shriram General Insurance. “On this National Insurance Awareness Day, we at ManipalCigna Health Insurance emphasize the vital role health insurance plays in securing a healthier future for all. Health insurance is a living benefit product; so just as mutual funds are essential for financial growth, health insurance is crucial to access easy and lifetime quality healthcare without the burden of unforeseen medical expenses. So, everyone should consider the benefits of health insurance and make it a priority,” said Prasun Sikdar, MD & CEO, ManipalCigna Health Insurance. “In a country like India, where many families lack sufficient financial protection, it is crucial to understand not just the importance of life insurance but also the need for adequate coverage. While it's promising that nearly 70% of families have some form of life insurance, the key question remains: is the coverage adequate? Underinsurance can leave loved ones vulnerable, and the entire insurance ecosystem, led by the regulator, is undertaking numerous measures to ensure that everyone understands the need for the right cover. This Insurance Awareness Day is an opportune time to highlight this critical issue. The general rule of thumb is to secure life cover that is 10 times your annual income,” said Anil PM, Head of Legal, Compliance, and FPU at Bajaj Allianz Life.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/medical-insurance-claims-irdai-cashless-approvals-guidelines-faster-processing-hospital-discharge-delays-11717082598158.html,Health insurance: New rule for faster cashless approvals might get off to a slow start,4 min read.01 Jun 2024,"The insurance regulator’s recent rule changes to make life easier for policyholders will likely require a sectoral overhaul before patients are able to get discharged from hospitals faster. While insurance industry experts pin the blame on hospitals for slow processing at the time of a patient’s discharge, a lot of the delays in cashless aprovals of medical claims also stem from procedural hiccups. A new digital information-sharing platform still in the discussion stage and an increased role for technology platforms might, however, help the regulator achieve its ambition of ensuring that patients cleared for discharge aren’t held back because of protracted processing. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India recently made it mandatory for medical insurance firms to authorise cashless hospitalisation within 1 hour of a request being made, and within 3 hours for a final approval at discharge. The new rules are to be implemented by 31 July. This, however, is unlikely to ease the plight of policyholders, say industry experts. For one, according to several experts Mint spoke with, hospitals spend much time in processing medical bills and sending them to insurers. “If there is a delay of 12 hours after the treating doctor gives a go-ahead for discharge, hospitals will have taken 8 hours and insurance companies the rest,” said Dr. Prashant Mishra, a Mumbai-based cardiac surgeon. The other significant challenge arises when insurance companies seek additional information from hospitals. “The tariffs for many surgeries are fixed in packages. But disputes arise on what is covered or not in the package. (Insurance firms) disallow certain billing and negotiate rates,” said Dr. G. Anil Krishna, chairman and managing director at Medicover Hospitals. “So far as cashless pre-approval is concerned, (insurers) tend to ask for a lot of documents to figure out if an insurance is valid or not. For example, ascertaining if a patient is really a non-smoker and a non-alcoholic as he or she claimed,” he added. “Medical care in India is subsidised but is still unaffordable for many. Finding an ideal solution is difficult.” Dr. S. Prakash, MD and CEO-designate at Galaxy Health and Allied Insurance, offered a counter. “Delays arise from both insurer-related issues and hospital-related issues, such as hospitals not adhering to all insurance provider requirements.” There might, however, be a solution or two in the near future. The Union health ministry is holding discussions to establish a National Health Claim Exchange (NHCX), an online platform comprising stakeholders including hospitals, insurance companies, and third-party administrators (or TPAs, which are intermediaries between insurers and policyholders). The exchange would enable sharing of claims information digitally, allowing for faster processing. NHCX will create a standard interface to be followed by all participants, but would require patients to give their consent for sharing their health history for it to be effective. They can do this by creating an Ayushman Bharat Health Account and uploading their health history. ABHA is a digital health card issued by the National Health Authority under India’s flagship health mission. “It is a great idea that will improve the turnaround time and reduce the cost from all ends if all stakeholders adopt,” said Narendra Bharindwal, vice president, Insurance Brokers Association of India. “The challenge is hospitals are unregulated. We have to see how many of them join the platform.” Apollo Hospitals, Sterling Hospitals and Manipal Hospital did not immediately reply to emails seeking comments. Also read | Irdai’s policy rollback: How it affects insurance surrenders The National Health Claim Exchange, apart, insure-tech companies could help reduce manual processing at hospitals and insurance companies, effectively bringing down the time taken to decide on a claim. Insure-tech companies can play a crucial role in shortening the claims journey via automation, said Sumit Ramani, actuary and co-founder at ProtectMeWell.com. For example, while extracting information from a medical document and converting it into medical codes requires experts, the process is increasingly getting automated using artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, he added. “Once the information is converted into medical codes, it would need to be compared to the benefits covered under the policy to identify payable claims,” said Ramani. “Equally running predefined rules to curb fraud, wastage, and abuse becomes easier on standardised data, thus increasing confidence, turnaround time, and accuracy of claims processed.” The insurance industry, as well as the medical sector in general, is awaiting the establishment of a health regulator that can standardise treatment costs and processes across hospitals. “Standardising tariffs across the industry can help in reducing turnaround time well below 3 hours even in complex billing where to-and-fro happens,” said Bhaskar Nerurkar, head-health administration team, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. “We take about 30 minutes on average in cashless pre-approvals and about 47 minutes after receiving bills from the hospital,” he added. “In cases where the process takes more than 3 hours, the company will take a favourable decision for the customer.” Also read | New health insurance regulator may arrive faster than we thought There are two types of hospitalisation—planned and emergency. Most planned hospitalisations do not require much time for insurance approvals. “Typically, 80% of the cases with planned hospitalisation do not face delays after insurance companies receive the billing,” said Bharindwal of the Insurance Brokers Association of India. “But there could be a delay in the rest of the cases where additional information from hospitals are required.” Irdai also recently allowed customers the option to increase the sum insured or opt for a no-claim discount on the premium at the time of renewal. Presently, only the former is offered. A customer having multiple health insurance policies can decide the order in which they want to make a claim, said Mahavir Chopra, co-founder of insurance platform Beshak.org. “Insurance companies will have to coordinate with each other, not policyholders.” Also read | Insurance reforms in first 100 days agenda of BJP government if voted back Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

By removing the age ceiling of 65 years for purchasing health insurance, IRDAI has expanded access to health insurance products for individuals of various age groups. Previously, seniors above 65 years could still buy health coverage, but options were limited in the market. ""With these policy changes, senior citizens will have a smooth access to quality healthcare. Further, while shortlisting the right coverage that suits their needs, consumers should also evaluate factors like a cashless network of healthcare providers of an insurer, room rent limit, benefits, sub-limits and other policy terms and conditions. These would enable individuals to get coverage that aligns perfectly with their requirements and budget, said spokesperson Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance. ""The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) has ushered in a transformative change by eliminating the 65-year age limit for health insurance purchases. This groundbreaking decision, effective from April 1, will ensure health coverage is now accessible to all, transcending age barriers. ’’ Pooja Yadav, chief product officer, Zuno General Insurance. According to Ajay Shah, health insurance premiums for senior citizens, especially those with pre-existing conditions, might be higher depending on the sum insured, age, and health condition. “The impact of IRDAI's decision on health insurance for senior citizens is expected to be profound. Insurance companies will likely respond by designing specialized products tailored to the needs of this demographic, including coverage for pre-existing conditions,” said Rakesh Jain, CEO, Reliance General Insurance Managing the higher risks linked with insuring older age groups, like more medical expenses and pre-existing conditions, is a major concern. Rakesh Jain noted that adjusting underwriting practices to properly evaluate and price these risks while staying competitive is a significant challenge. Moreover, Jain highlighted that providing affordable and comprehensive coverage for senior citizens in the face of increasing healthcare costs needs innovative product design and risk management strategies. Previously, individuals were limited to buying new insurance policies until age 65. However, effective April 1, 2024, the insurance regulator removed the age cap on purchasing health insurance policies. ""Insurers shall ensure that they offer health insurance products to cater to all age groups. Insurers may design products specifically for senior citizens, students, children, maternity, and any other group as specified by the Competent Authority,"" IRDAI had said in a notification issued earlier. Industry experts believe this initiative encourages competition among insurers, potentially resulting in better consumer offerings and services. Ultimately, it sets the stage for enhanced financial security and long-term health planning for senior citizens.

In certain cases, even an insurance holder ends up paying out of his pocket (OOP) on some medical expenses. To specifically help such cases, the recently-propped up healthcare fintechs provide services such as no-cost EMI loans, embedded insurance, etc. Unlike health insurance which provides coverage of a certain amount in return for regular premiums (with conditions linked to waiting periods, diseases covered, etc), healthcare fintechs provide interest-free credit regardless of the type of treatment. “We cover what insurance does not. A customer can avail of over 300 healthcare treatments and services across our network, including preventive and elective treatments as well,” said Jitin Bhasin, founder of SaveIn healthcare fintech. “Ironically, people can buy a no-cost EMI washing machine, but they can't buy a no-cost EMI for knee replacement operation. That is the problem that we wanted to solve by simplifying healthcare expenses,” said Chris George, founder of QubeHealth, a healthcare fintech. The B2B startup provides two key products to the employees or members of its corporate clients. First is Qube Pay, a UPI-based payment feature and second is Qube Cash, which provides credit up to  ₹10 lakh on zero interest for 12 months. Easily available credit can be used for treatments that are not covered in health insurance plans like cosmetic surgery, hair transplant, etc. When basic health insurance plans fail to cover certain treatments like the ones that don’t require hospitalisation, it is easier to unlock a customised credit line with the help of healthcare fintech services, according to Jatin Bhasin, SaveIn founder. Underlining the vast coverage of healthcare treatment services by SaveIn, Bhasin said, “Several credit-card holders with SaveIn’s no-cost EMI plans can pay for their healthcare within 10 seconds and avail a loan for 3,6,9, and even 12 months on zero-cost EMIs.” Customers can visit SaveIN partners near them and can avail of healthcare products and treatments at zero or low-cost EMIs. Embedded insurance refers to insurance coverage which is integrated or included as a part of another product or service. QubeHealth is working to build a system where users can avail the benefit of customised embedded insurance while making a medical transaction, noted Chris George. “When expecting parents will pay for maternity expenses with Qube Pay, they will get an embedded insurance product that essentially pays for all of paediatric care after the child is born,” said George while explaining the service which will be included in the Qube Pay app in future. QubeHealth is in the process of utilising artificial intelligence for building predictive spending and pattern analysis. The AI-driven feature of the QubePay application would provide suggestions related to hospitalisation and healthcare based on the kind of health insurance plan that has been taken by its customer. The company has rolled out this AI-led feature on a trial basis and will expand this service to a larger user base in future.  The application will also provide suggestions based on medical history, which will be stored digitally in the form of e-reports.

Before investing in an insurance policy, it is paramount to understand the fundamental terminology. Before you invest in an insurance policy, it's essential to understand the basic terminology for better coverage comprehension. Understanding terms like premiums, deductibles, coverage limits, and policy riders is essential for better usage of insurance policies. In an interview with Mint,  Sharad Bajaj, COO, ofInsuranceDekho discussed the key components of insurance Understanding both what is covered (inclusions) and what is not (exclusions), as well as any limitations or restrictions, helps avoid surprises when filing a claim. The financial side of insurance involves premiums and deductibles. Premiums, determined by assessing risk and coverage, determine the insurance cost. Deductibles are the amount the policyholder must pay out of pocket before insurance starts. It directly impacts out-of-pocket expenses and monthly premiums. Each insurance policy has coverage limits, which represent the maximum amount the insurer will pay for a covered loss. It's essential to comprehend these limits to prevent being underinsured and experiencing financial strain during a substantial loss. Policy riders and endorsements provide flexibility, which is crucial in insurance. These optional additions enable policyholders to customize their coverage to better suit their needs, whether by adding protection for specific risks or enhancing existing coverage. Submitting an insurance claim can feel overwhelming, especially when facing difficult circumstances. Familiarising oneself with the claims process, including documentation needs and resolution timelines, can simplify the process and ensure a smoother experience during challenging times. Insurance isn't a one-time thing; it's ongoing. Understanding how to renew or cancel policies is crucial. Being aware of renewal deadlines, premium adjustments, and any terms that impact policy continuation or termination is essential for continuous coverage. Understanding insurance rules and regulations may appear daunting, but unraveling its complexities is not impossible. It's always recommended to carefully read and understand all terms and conditions. Note: This story is for informational purposes only.

Here’s when you can get a full refund from the airline,2 min read.14 Mar 2024,"Let’s assume you are on a vacation with a full-planned itinerary. You are set to return home on a certain date, but due to some unavoidable reasons, you now need to return earlier. LiveMint talked to experts to understand under what circumstances a person who has taken travel insurance would be allowed to get a full refund of their return tickets. According to Manas Kapoor, business head of Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com, travellers can get a full refund in the case of a medical emergency. This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies. Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the Supreme Court of India, added, “The definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.” Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, “but majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.” Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund. “In such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,” said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors. Kapoor explained that these documents may include proofs like admission to a hospital and a doctor’s advice on returning. According to Bajaj, there are some other cases when an airline may have to fully refund a traveller. “In cases where the airline cancels a flight due to bad weather, mechanical issues, or staffing problems or if there is a significant rescheduling in the flight timings, the passengers are entitled to get a full refund regardless of the reason for cancellation,” Bajaj said. However, in these cases, according to the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), an airline is bound to provide a traveller with an alternative at no additional cost. If one does not accept it, they are not bound to get any compensation. “One is not entitled to any compensation or refund in case you don’t accept alternative travel arrangements or if the cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, like any force majeure events like civil war, natural disasters, security risks, government regulations etc,” said Sneha Bhogle Kale, partner at Accord Juris LLP. The compensation or refund is covered under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), Section-3, Series-M, Part-IV of the DGCA rules.

Reproductive Health Services: expanded insurance coverage that includes reproductive health services such as contraception, fertility treatments, and reproductive surgeries can empower women to make informed decisions about their health and family planning, improving female mortality and India’s sex ratio which stands at about 929:1000(female:male ratio) Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in Indian women, and survival rates post 5 years of incidence are just 66%, amongst the lowest in the world. Tailored insurance plans can offer coverage for breast cancer screening, diagnostic tests, treatments, and post-treatment care to ensure early detection and effective management of the disease. Gender-specific Illnesses Coverage: Insurance policies include coverage for gender-specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometriosis, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. Women-specific Health Check-ups: Insurance policies can include coverage for regular health check-ups, preventive screenings, and wellness programs tailored to women's health needs. Critical Illness Coverage: Comprehensive coverage for critical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes can ensure access to advanced medical treatments and ongoing care for women facing serious health challenges. The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2021-22 highlights that the Female labour force participation (FLFPR) rate in India for the working age group (15 years & above) has increased considerably to 32.8%, still well below the global average of 47 percent for several years. Boosting women's entrepreneurship: Insurance schemes can support women entrepreneurs by providing packaged coverage for businesses, business interruption coverage plans, and fostering entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. Income Protection: Income protection plans specifically designed for women can provide financial support in case of career breaks due to childbirth, caregiving responsibilities, or health issues. Childcare Support: Insurance plans may offer childcare benefits to help working mothers cover the costs of childcare services, enabling them to balance work and family responsibilities effectively. By incorporating these various coverage into insurance policies, insurers would effectively address the specific needs and priorities of women, promoting gender equality, financial inclusion, and overall well-being.

Hence, it is important to be financially prepared for such fatal diseases with health coverage. Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance. Also Read: Focus on essential features when choosing health insurance, says Vivek Chaturvedi By 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022. On World Cancer Day, know about the insurance options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses. Also Read: The Role of Cancer Insurance in Cancer Prevention and Early Detection A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment. Also Read: 9.3 lakh lives lost to cancer in India, urging the need for comprehensive health insurance There is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer. “A cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,” explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal. One of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc. Also Read: Here’s why doctors should consider professional indemnity insurance “A critical illness cover acts as a top–up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,” noted Singhal. A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it “offers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions”. However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed. “A cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,” Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint. Sum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to  ₹30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of  ₹50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal. Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. “Hence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,” said Singhal. In addition to this, it is equally important to compare and analyse various cancer coverage plans online for an informed decision. Moreover, it is a must to have a better understanding of the exclusions in the policy. Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Highlighting the need for the individual risk profiling, IRDAI Chief Debasish Panda said data analytics should ensure that premiums take into account the individual risk and not the average risk of the group. ""There is need to build an ecosystem where premiums are no longer one-size-fits all but are customised to individual risk profiling,"" he said. The IRDAI Chief also said that the regulator is nudging insurers to adopt the account aggregator framework, a consent-based architecture for seamless exchange of information. ""So far 28 insurers have onboarded as financial information providers and another 32 as financial information users while 27 have been onboarded as both,"" he said. In order to maintain an open dialogue with the industry, the regulator has been conducting quarterly meetings, called Bima Manthan, with executives to take their feedback on different issues. ""Bima manthan is an excellent feedback mechanism to understand how the regulatory architecture is getting translated on the ground. For example, the feedback led to the introduction of a simple customer information sheet in health insurance,"" he said. IRDAI has mandated insurers to create the revised CIS from January 1 onwards. CIS will include material details of health insurance policies such as sum assured, exclusions, sub-limits, etc in a simplified language. “Same would be introduced in other lines of business,” he added. To promote further innovation, the regulator conducts an insuretech open house where it interacts with tech companies on a monthly basis to understand and implement innovative solutions that give a fillip to the insurance sector. Panda also said that they are considering a provision that would require laws to be reviewed every three years to keep pace with changing times in the insurance industry. “We are considering a sunset clause of three years on regulations for policy dynamism,"" said Panda. “From 100 odd policy regulations, we are hoping to have 15-odd regulations to streamline industry growth. This is what will provide ease of doing business and the operational freedom and flexibility"" he said. Panda also added that they have appointed an expert committee that will look into simplifying the language of the insurance so that it becomes more comprehensible for the citizens who buy insurance policies. He said that a report on this matter will come out soon. “The insurance industry is categorized for using jargon. We are looking into simplifying the policy document,"" said Panda on the topic ‘Insurance’s innovation agenda’. The IRDAI chief also talked about the Bima trinity which is being conceptualised. He said that the trinity includes Bima Vistar,a simple benefit based product based on pragmatic triggers, Bima Vahak, which is a localised women centric insurance scheme by the community and Bema Sugam, an electronic platform which would universalise and democratise insurance products. “I believe this will a game chnager in the insurance landscape,” said Panda. “This protocal would be connected to the India Stack to utilise the unique national digital infrastructure enabling seamless delivery of insurance“ Panda also highlighted the growth of affordable insurance schemes by the government like the like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Joti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY).

According to a report by Live Law, Justice Anand Venkatesh emphasized the work done by AYUSH doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and added that traditional medicines were also recommended to the infected patient under AYUSH which provided relief to several patients. Therefore the Madras HC asserted that it would be irrelevant to deprive policyholders of getting reimbursements for the amount spent on AYUSH treatments under the medical insurance. The court also said that an individual decides to either opt for an AYUSH treatment or an Allopathic treatment, therefore, the expenses incurred in either of the treatments had to be placed on equal scales. Medical inflation surges at an alarming rate The judge said giving preference to allopathy would be discriminatory and directed IRDAI to draft a policy keeping AYUSH treatments in mind. The Madras HC also asked IRDAI to encourage traditional treatments like AYUSH. It said patients who undergo such treatments should be entitled to receive the insurance amount for the expenses incurred by him. Dental treatment is costly.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/explained-the-importance-of-travel-insurance-in-a-shrinking-world-11699347727849.html,Explained: The importance of travel insurance in a shrinking world,3 min read.07 Nov 2023,"As the world shrinks, people travel to far-off places for work and pleasure. Travel insurance now assumes greater importance than ever before. Travel insurance is very important especially while you are travelling abroad. Let us discuss what it covers and when one should buy it. Though the word “Travel Insurance” suggests that expenses related to travel only are covered but travel insurance covers more than that. It also covers your hospitalisation while you are abroad which is important because the health insurance purchased by you in India generally covers your hospitalisation in India only. Some of the countries make the purchase of travel insurance a precondition before the issuance of a visa. Looking at the cost of medical treatments in some developed countries, it is a prerequisite for you to buy adequate travel insurance to safeguard yourself against a big hole in your pocket. Generally, travel insurance covers your loss of checked-in baggage, the cost of treatment, and hospitalisation abroad. Though most of the insurers do not cover your pre-existing disease a few of the insurers cover the treatment in case of life-threatening diseases. This also covers loss suffered due to delay or cancellation of your flights. It also covers any emergency arising out of delay or cancellation of flights. Since international travel insurance is supposed to cover majorly your hospitalisation, you should take into account the cost of hospitalisation in the country you are travelling to. Moreover, as it covers the loss of your checked-in luggage, you should take into account the value of your valuable belongings like your camera, laptop, etc. which you are carrying with you. You also need to factor in the cost of ticketing as well as hotel stay in case of delay or cancellation of flights. In case you are a frequent flier, you can buy a Multi-Trip travel insurance that covers you for all future trips taken within a specific period, with the same level of cover. For instance, if you buy an annual multi-trip travel insurance plan, you will be covered for any trips you go on during that year. However, in case your travel is one thing, you should buy travel insurance before undertaking that journey. The premium of the travel insurance will depend on the period for which you are buying the travel insurance as well as the country you are travelling. Since hospitalisation is the major item that is covered under travel insurance, the premium will depend on the country you are travelling to. Some of the companies offer you cheaper insurance with sub-limits. Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights! Click here For domestic travel, you may decide not to buy the insurance in case you are adequately covered under your regular health insurance. You may still decide to cover the two other elements of coverage like loss of baggage and loss due to delay or cancellation of flights but generally nobody buys domestic travel insurance. One should buy travel insurance before one undertakes a trip whether it is a foreign trip or domestic trip. One can buy it online as well if one is comfortable doing it. The travel insurance to buy will depend on the country and period for which you are travelling and thus you will have to compare the premium and features of various insurance companies which provides travel insurance. Since most of the insurance companies provide you with instant quotes based on the data fed, you can check and compare a few insurance company websites to zero on specific products. Keep in mind that selecting the right insurance policy has to be done carefully, since just like regular insurance, travel insurance comes in many options, and there is no one right plan.

The capital infusion would be based on the financial performance of the general insurers  in nine months, the report also said. According to the PTI report citing sources, the finance ministry last year asked three insurers to chase bottomlines rather than topline and underwrite only good proposals. Last year, the government had provided  ₹5,000 crore capital to National Insurance Company Ltd, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd and United India Insurance Company. Kolkata-based National Insurance Company was provided  ₹3,700 crore, followed by Delhi-based Oriental Insurance Company ( ₹1,200 crore) and Chennai-based United India Insurance ( ₹100 crore). During fiscal year 2019-20, the government infused  ₹2,500 crore in these three companies. In the following year, it increased substantially to  ₹9,950 crore and  ₹5,000 crore in fiscal year 2021-22. “The financial review would give some idea about the impact of restructuring initiated on the profitability numbers and the solvency margin,” said the report. The solvency margin, the extra capital the companies must hold over and above the claim amounts they are likely to incur, acts as a financial backup in extreme situations. The three general insurers  have been asked to improve their solvency ratio and meet the regulatory requirement of 150%. The solvency ratio is a measure of capital adequacy. A higher ratio reflects better financial health and the ability of the company to pay claims and meet future contingencies and business growth plans. The solvency ratio of the three public sector general insurance companies is below the regulatory requirement of 150%.

The meeting with the General Insurance Council and leaders and CEOs of private sector general insurance companies discussed the concerns of the insurance industry, which is facing penalties imposed by tax authorities for Goods and Services Tax (GST) input tax credit violations. Notably, the finance ministry has so far refrained from intervening in this matter. The meeting also discussed initiatives to enhance public awareness through continuous engagement with individual states, aimed at elevating insurance penetration and coverage. Discussions also revolved around the imperative need to streamline distribution channels, particularly in expanding the agency channel within the general insurance industry to further augment insurance penetration. The meeting underscored the need for a more robust and coordinated approach between states and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to launch a special drive to ensure compliance with the Motor Vehicles Act and enhance collaboration with the Ministry of Health to elevate the prevalence of cashless facilities and standardize treatment costs, thereby fostering growth within the health insurance sector. Insurance companies were asked to actively promote the adoption of property/parametric covers that serve as essential tools to mitigate financial losses caused by natural catastrophes, and extend insurance coverage to the MSME sector. Addressing the issue of fraud prevention, participants in the meeting recognized the necessity of linking insurance frauds to the CIBIL score as a means of enhancing security and accountability within the industry. It was also agreed that regular meetings will be convened with representatives from both the private and public sectors of the insurance industry. These regular meetings will serve as a platform for fostering continuous collaborative efforts that will contribute to the growth and development of the insurance sector.

Discussions on this matter have taken place in Life Insurance Council meetings over the past few months, two sources told The Economic Times. While a formal letter from the council is pending, the sources state that talks are in an advanced stage, aiming to establish self-regulation in this regard, they added. The development comes as the industry adjusts its marketing practices in response to IRDAI's decision to replace product-wise caps with company-wise ones, a move prompted by insurers facing GST evasion charges, as per the report. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) is the regulatory authority of the insurance sector. In March, the regulator introduced the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, shifting from the traditional product-specific commission structure to an overall cap on expenses within insurance companies. The directive mandated managing operations within a 30 percent overall expense limit. Despite being allowed to pay 5 percent on commissions until March, insurers often opted for higher overriding commissions of 30-35 percent or more to enhance market share, the report said. It was thus found that in certain insurer-bank or insurer-NBFC partnerships, where a housing loan of  ₹1 crore aligns with a policy sum assured of the same amount, the premium has surged to 35 percent, up from 5 percent until March, it added. Credit life insurance, a type designed to aid loan repayment in case of the insured person's demise before full repayment, has seen a significant increase in premiums. While the policy is optional, if chosen, its cost is added to the loan principal. The alteration in commission structures was prompted by scrutiny from the GST authorities, who issued show-cause notices to numerous insurance companies. The investigation revealed that insurers were paying overriding commissions to agents through vendors, falsely categorized as marketing, advertising, and manpower supply costs, evading tax without actual services rendered. Many insurance companies are now under examination for providing overriding commissions to banks and intermediaries, in addition to regular commissions. This practice raises concerns about potential exploitation and an increase in management expenses within the insurance industry. The investigation brought to light that insurance companies were covering banks' employee costs through intermediaries, not transparently represented in their financial records, leading to non-disclosure and potential violations of tax laws.

The launch of the platform, which has already missed two deadlines, has now been rescheduled for June 2024. The regulator claims that the proposed portal will be a ‘game-changer’ and a ‘UPI moment’ for the insurance sector. Bima Sugam aims to simplify the process of purchasing insurance for consumers.  This online platform is where customers can choose a suitable scheme from multiple options given by various companies.  All insurance requirements, including those for life, health, and general insurance (including motor and travel) will be met by Bima Sugam. ""This platform will help in the settlement of claims, whether it’s health coverage or death claims, in a paperless manner on the basis of policy numbers. In short, identifying the right policy, buying it, and settling the claims and renewals will be streamlined in the online process that Bima Sugam will introduce. Insurance companies (both general and life insurers) will be major shareholders in the platform, which will offer facilities to customers via an ‘e-insurance account’ (E-IA),” said Tejinder Singh senior consultant of Alpha Capital. It will facilitate insurance companies to access the validated and authentic data from various touch points on a real-time basis. The platform will interface for the intermediaries and agents to sell policies and provide services to policyholders, among others, and reduce paperwork. Further, the paperwork involved in buying a policy will also come down. Settlement of claims and renewal of policies will also become faster as paperwork is reduced drastically, making it easier for the customers. The scheme shall benefit consumers more than the agents, since this will affect the commissions drastically and reduce paperwork involved in processing the claims. “IRDAI’s robust platform will benefit insurers, hospitals, and policyholders alike. This exchange will serve as a centralized hub for health insurance-related activities; ensuring efficient policy management, quick & hassle-free processing of claims, automatic fund transfer for policyholders & hospitals, and reduced cost per claim to the insurer,” said Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance. It will provide end-to-end solutions for customers’ insurance needs i.e., purchase, service, and settlement in a seamless manner. “First, you can buy policies, pay premiums, and settle all claims on a single platform. You don’t have to visit the websites of different insurers separately. Secondly, you can choose a repository to maintain all your insurance policies. If you have all the links stored in one place, claim settlement will become easier for nominees and beneficiaries,” said Tejinder Singh With this proactive measure, IRDAI looks forward to driving positive change in the industry. The initiative will not only meet changing market demands but also position India as a thought leader for insurance innovation.

HDFC Life, SBI Life closely follow",1 min read.16 Sep 2023,"Securing the financial future of our loved ones is a responsibility that resonates with us all. As the insurance landscape flourishes, it's crucial to shine a spotlight on a key determinant of an insurer's trustworthiness – the claim settlement ratio. While many factors influence the choice of a life insurance policy, the claim settlement ratio often remains overlooked despite its profound significance. Let’s have a look at the most recent claim settlement ratio of the life insurance company for Q1FY24.  The chart clearly highlights that ICICI Prudential Life Insurance stands at the top of the chart by settling 97.9% of the claims received and providing the best customer service. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has always kept the claim settlement ratio as one of the most important aspects considering that customers trust them with their hard-earned money. ICICI Pru is followed by SBI Life with a 95.8% claim settlement ratio, HDFC Life  with a 96.7% claim settlement ratio An interesting fact, Under their ‘Claim for sure initiative’ death claims will be settled in 1 day, provided some terms and conditions are met, the company claims. With the ‘Claim For Sure’ service initiative, the company aims to reduce the financial distress caused to families due to this loss. A claim settlement ratio highlights the proportion of insurance claims that an insurer successfully addresses in comparison to the total claims lodged by policyholders or their beneficiaries. This ratio is computed by dividing the total count of settled insurance claims by the overall number of claims received by the insurance company, then multiplying the result by 100. For instance, if an insurer receives 10,000 new claims within a specific year and resolves 9,800 of those claims while keeping the rest unresolved due to various reasons, the claim settlement ratio for that year would be calculated as (9,800/10,000 × 100), which equals 98%. As a general guideline, a claim settlement ratio exceeding 80% is deemed favorable. Leading insurance firms in the nation consistently maintain a claim settlement ratio surpassing 95%. Considering the claim settlement ratio when purchasing life insurance is pivotal. It reflects the insurer's reliability, ethical practices, and efficiency in processing claims. A high ratio not only assures timely financial support for beneficiaries but also offers peace of mind and effective financial planning.

In the survey, which covered over 1,000 people in the age group of 28 to 55, ACKO found out that following the COVID-19 pandemic, awareness about health insurance has increased. However, it also added that the health coverage of most Indians is insufficient compared to the medical expenses. Among other details, the insurance company said that though 60 percent say they understand the policy terms and conditions, but their awareness is primarily limited to cash treatment, accident cover, and 100 percent bill payment. Also, 60 percent of respondents do not think of buying health insurance with over  ₹10 lakh coverage, while 65 percent believe that  ₹10 lakh health coverage is sufficient for them. Apart from this, 64 percent said they have not increased the coverage and kept it the same as the previous year. On this parameter, 46 percent of policyholders said that their health policy covers the entire ‘hospitalization along with consumables’, while 59 percent of potential buyers are looking for policies with 100 percent bill payment. Also, 27 percent are unaware of the waiting period and said that 'there are no waiting periods in the health insurance policies', and 31 percent feel that they are covered from day 1. The survey even found out that among the existing and potential policyholders, the family floater policies are the top favorite, with 71 percent and 72 percent, respectively. Citing the reasons, policyholders said that the plans offer them the option to include their parents, spouses, and children in the same policy. The deterrents working against the health insurance companies include a slow claim settlement process, partial bill payment, and inadequate network hospitals.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/jio-financial-to-enter-insurance-plans-global-tieups-11693247734718.html,"Jio Financial to enter insurance, plans global tie-ups",2 min read.29 Aug 2023,"Jio Financial Services Ltd (JFSL) is set to launch a slew of insurance products, possibly in partnership with global companies, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on Monday. “JFSL will enter the insurance segment to offer simple, yet smart, life-, general- and health-insurance products through a seamless digital interface, potentially partnering with global players,” Ambani said at RIL’s virtual annual general meeting. Although Jio Financial has been seen as a disruptor in the financial-services space given Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s runaway success in telecom, many believe it wouldn’t be easy to replicate that success in insurance and other financial-sector products. That is because the financial-services space is more tightly regulated and established entities such as banks, non-banks and insurance firms have built their businesses over years. Still, Jio’s entry could lead to greater penetration of insurance in India. Insurance penetration, or the ratio of total insurance premiums to gross domestic product (GDP), in the country rose from 2.7% around the turn of the millennium to 4.2% in 2020, and remained the same in 2021, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23. The company, Ambani said, will use predictive data analytics to co-create contextual products with partners. Last October, RIL announced the demerger of its financial-services business. As part of the demerger, each RIL shareholder received shares in Jio Financial on a 1:1 basis in July. So far, Jio has tied up with BlackRock, the US manager of $11 trillion in assets for an asset management venture in India. “JFSL has been conceptualized to fill a critical gap in the financial-services needs of a large section of the Indian economy, mainly in the informal and underserved sectors in rural, semi-urban, and urban areas,” said Ambani. He said for tens of thousands of small businesses, merchants, and self-employed entrepreneurs, the ease of doing business must mean ease in borrowing, investments, and payment solutions. Jio Financial, he said, plans to democratize financial services for 1.42 billion Indians, giving them access to simple, affordable, innovative, and intuitive products and services. “In payments, JFSL will consolidate its payments infrastructure with a ubiquitous offering for both consumers and merchants, further driving digital payment adoption for India,” he said. Ambani said Jio Financial products will not just compete with current industry benchmarks but also explore features such as blockchain-based platforms and central bank digital currency (CBDC). “They will adhere to the highest standards of security, regulatory norms, and ensure protection of customer transaction data at all times,” he said. RIL has capitalized Jio Financial with a net worth of  ₹1.2 trillion to create one of the world’s highest capitalized financial-service platforms at inception, he said, adding that it has a strong board, led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath. “A highly motivated leadership team is being built with a combination of financial industry experts and young leaders who are eager to take on big challenges,” Ambani said.

The need for comprehensive health coverage for senior citizens has become more apparent, however, the penetration continues to be a challenge. According to census reports, India has 1,380 lakh elderly citizens and is further expected to increase by around 560 lakh by 2031. However, only 25 per cent companies - out of Plum’s over 3,500 customer base- have parental covers. This leaves a wide gap in coverage for senior citizens, who include parents and parent in-laws. The insurtech surveyed around 300 customers and observed that 29 per cent of employees feel that the organisation-sponsored health insurance is inadequate in terms of the sum insured. It also found that 13 per cent of employees availed super top-up as the organisation-sponsored insurance does not cover parents and family. There has been a steady demand from employees around the need for coverage for the elderly, and one way to approach this is through super top-ups (in addition to increased parental coverage). ""In the face of the silent crisis gripping our senior citizens, Plum is committed to confronting this challenge head-on.  The 98 per cent of uninsured senior citizens is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities they face,'' said said Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and CEO of Plum. ‘’It will always be our endeavour to innovate and come up with solutions that simplify access and availability of health insurance towards the underinsured. Our goal is to contribute to the larger vision of 'Insurance for All by 2047', ensuring that every individual, regardless of their age or circumstances, can access the protection they deserve,'' added Poddar. Amid rising costs for basic healthcare access in India, medical coverage for parents and senior citizens has become increasingly critical. For citizens in this age group, the coverage often goes beyond basic protection, encompassing valuable supplementary benefits such as cashless hospitalisation, critical illness insurance, as well as targeted coverage for conditions such as cancer and stroke.

The detailed 17-page guidelines posted on the tax authority’s website explained the changes introduced in the Income Tax Act this year with situations and examples. The guidelines are issued to remove difficulties in giving effect to the provisions introduced this year. Income Tax Act exempts any income received from an insurance policy including the bonus amount from tax. This year, this provision was modified to exclude insurance policies in which annual premium in any of the previous years was more than  ₹500,000. This was made in order to ensure that tax benefits meant for ordinary persons are not cornered by the super rich. “This provision was introduced to nullify the tax advantage given to investments disguised as insurance policies,” explained Amit Maheshwari, Tax Partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm. “Since this provision would impact many individuals, especially the rich, CBDT has issued guidelines to remove difficulties, which is a welcome move. The guidelines are elaborate and give various examples on the computation of consideration eligible for exemption,” said Maheshwari.

Six factors individuals with pre-existing conditions should be aware of while purchasing a plan,1 min read.25 Jul 2023,"Health Insurance: Healthcare costs are skyrocketing significantly. And, this is when health insurance comes in handy. The financial security of an individual is protected by having health insurance. With the ever-rising instances of diseases, health insurance today is a necessity. However, there are several things one needs to keep in mind at the time of purchasing health insurance. Experts advise people to disclose pre-existing conditions or diseases while buying a health insurance policy. It is important to keep in mind that insurers charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing illnesses. According to Ajay Shah, Head – Distribution, Care Health Insurance while purchasing health insurance for an individual with pre-existing medical conditions, there are a few crucial factors that one needs to keep in mind. 1)First among them is to ensure that the Health Insurance policy covers the pre-existing ailment and its contingent/related conditions. 2)Secondly, a thorough understanding of the terms and conditions of the waiting period for the ailment is necessary. 3)The policyholder should read policy documents carefully and understand if any limitations or exclusions such as co-payment, sub-limit, or deductible apply to the pre-existing disease. 4) Some policies may not cover or have limits on coverage for certain procedures or treatment of these pre–existing ailments. Being aware of these limitations helps one make informed decisions about their health security. 5) Individuals with pre-existing diseases should declare all their medical conditions in the proposal form filing or during the process of underwriting. 6) Some people may have to pay a higher premium as compared to those without such conditions. Therefore, it becomes crucial for one to carefully compare premiums and terms & conditions across different insurers & products to find the best-suited plan at an affordable price. Awareness about these components can aid individuals in making informed choices while getting a health Insurance that not only covers their pre-existing diseases, but gives assured quality servicing at affordable prices – a truly Comprehensive Health Insurance plan, said Ajay Shah.

Know features,1 min read.19 Jul 2023,"Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has launched a new motor insurance offering called V-Pay. The add-on cover is only for private car owners, not for commercial vehicles. Under this add-on, the insuree can report multiple minor paint chips and/or scratches anytime during the policy period. Mechanical and electrical breakdowns that are not a result of accidents would also be covered by V-Pay, Bajaj Allianz said in a press statement. The V-Pay has an elite plan, comprising 22 features covering small scratches, mechanical and electrical breakdown, cyber risk cover, etc. The V-Pay will also be applicable if losses have occurred by a customer within Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Maldives. The V-Pay add-on has a ""Recalibration"" feature that ensures protection for the vehicle's digital sense devices as well. In current motor insurance policies, customers are bound to pay a compulsory deductible as per the standard terms and conditions of the policies. However, V-Pay eliminates the need for deductibles during a claim with its Waiver of Deductible feature, Bajaj Allianz mentioned. Moreover, if customers forget to declare additional accessories or CNG fitments, their vehicles are still protected during claims with coverage of up to 1% of the Insured Declared Value (IDV). Defence Cost is also covered in the Elite plan, which covers the fees of legal assistance to the customer for police and court proceedings. V-Pay will protect the insured’s vehicle from software issues, cyber extortion, and theft of funds resulting from cyber-attacks. V-Pay add-on cover is further extended to protect the insured’s vehicle with features like rally, depreciation waiver, tyre or rim protection, personal baggage, key replacement, vehicle retrieval, towing, vehicle replacement, 24x7 roadside assistance, and rodent bite. According to Bajaj Allianz, the period of insurance of VPay will be identical to the policy period of the base policy to which the addon cover is attached. Notably, the add-on cover would be available only at the time of purchasing a fresh motor insurance policy. The company has revealed the details of the premium. The customer will know about premium details after filling out the proposal form.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/curb-your-ai-enthusiasm-just-look-at-the-insurtech-carnage-11687979106954.html,Curb Your AI Enthusiasm: Just Look at the Insurtech Carnage,3 min read.29 Jun 2023,"Uprisings can fall short, even robotic ones. Investors riding the artificial-intelligence wave should look at the insurance industry for a cautionary tale. Shares in “insurtech” startups, which look to upend traditional insurance through the use of automation, data and AI, have enjoyed a small bounce lately thanks to the mania unleashed by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But they remain far below their levels a few years ago, when many went public. Is this a good opportunity for investors to jump ship, or rather the start of a rebound that will reward AI faith? A takeover proposal for car-insurance startup Root illustrates the dilemma. The $280 million offer from Embedded Insurance, a company run by serial insurtech entrepreneur James Hall, is much better than Root’s $85 million valuation before the bid, but also orders of magnitude below the almost $7 billion at which the company listed in 2020. Root has so far remained silent. Other startups that went public at about the same time as Root include Lemonade, Hippo, Oscar Health, Clover Health and Bright Health. They all trade at a fraction of what they were worth then. In theory, few industries should be easier to shake up than insurance, which scores very low on customer satisfaction and is run by big, boring corporations set in their own ways. Data and statistics have been at its very core ever since British mathematician James Dodson created the Equitable Life Assurance Society in the 18th century. As a result, venture capitalists love it: According to reinsurer Gallagher Re, they poured $49 billion into insurtech between 2014 and 2022. Funding fell back last year, but mostly because 2021 was wild. Unlike moonshots that promise air taxis or space tourism, these startups have sensible pitches. Root, which is backed by online used-car retailer Carvana, saw that the riskiness of drivers tends to be assessed through broad-brush variables such as age and occupation, leaving a gap for using telematics to assess individualized behavior, including factors such as gentle turning or not answering texts while driving. Similarly, Hippo employs “smart home” kits to constantly monitor risks of fire, water and other damages. Lemonade uses AI and techniques from behavioral economics to fast-track all types of insurance. Yet the revolters have failed to storm the gates. Root’s business has slowed lately, a red flag for investors looking for fast-growing companies with potential economies of scale. Even more concerning is that new technologies haven’t yet proven that they are better at pricing risks: Old-school insurers still have lower claims relative to premiums than insurtech firms, though the record of the latter group is improving. The digital age has never shown much sign of threatening insurance giants. They haven’t seen their market share eroded or even had to adapt their businesses much. Price-comparison websites may have injected some extra competition, but people haven’t fundamentally changed how they buy insurance, even as they embraced online apps to hail rides, get food delivered or go on vacation. That suggests even the takeover value of insurtech stocks may be low. As it turns out, incumbents had good reasons to be conservative. “20 years ago we thought distribution costs would be lower using the internet, but this is absolutely not the case: Paying Google is more expensive than paying an agent,” said Frédéric de Courtois, group deputy chief executive of French insurer Axa. New AI players face an additional problem: Growing aggressively means attracting riskier clients, and so they struggle to achieve scale. Without enough data, they can’t gain the edge required to compete in a very price-sensitive market. These lessons have broader applications. As happened with personal computers and then the internet, AI could greatly benefit its suppliers—software and chip behemoths, whose stocks have gained the most in the recent rally. It could also open up some new markets and, yes, upend how established players perform specific tasks. For insurers, it is opening new avenues for identifying fraud, for example. Investors who see revolution everywhere, however, could end up putting their own portfolios in the dock.

Ltd., the insurance regulator, on Friday, directed a take-over of the company’s all the 2 lakh-odd live insurance policies by India’s largest privately held life insurer SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Following a regulatory meeting on the issues plaguing Sahara India Life, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India or Irdai said in a release that the regulator has ordered an immediate transfer of Sahara’s life insurance business to SBI Life Insurance. “Upon reviewing Sahara India Life’s policy data, it has become apparent that the company's portfolio is experiencing a run-off trend,” said Irdai. Sahara India Life was started in 2004 as the first wholly Indian-owned life insurance firm by blotted entrepreneur Subroto Roy-promoted Sahara Group, whose entire business empire collapsed after India’s financial regulators caught Roy of swindling millions of investors through a bunch of ponzi schemes. Irdai’s Friday’s decision follows Sahara India Life’s failure to comply with the extant regulatory requirements and the insurer’s inability to take necessary steps to safeguard the interest of its policyholders, said the release by Irdai. Sahara India Life has faced “significant challenges regarding financial propriety and governance,” said the regulator. In 2017, due to these concerns, the Irdai had appointed an administrator to oversee the management of Sahara India Life, and had prohibited the insurer from underwriting any new business. “Despite numerous opportunities and ample time to rectify the situation, Sahara India Life Insurance has not addressed the issues adequately,” said Irdai. Irdai said Sahara India Life’s financial position has steadily deteriorated, with mounting losses and a higher percentage of claims in relation to total premium. “If this trend persists, it could lead to further capital erosion and Sahara India Life may not be able to discharge its liabilities towards policyholders, thereby endangering the interest of its policyholders,” said Irdai. Utilizing a special power under the Insurance Act, Irdai decided to transfer Sahara India Life’s insurance business to a suitable insurer (SBI Life Insurance) without delay. With a 7.98% market share SBI Life is the country’s largest private sector life insurer. For the fiscal 2023, SBI Life collected a new business premium of Rs. 29,587.60 crore, recording a 16.22% growth year-on-year. Irdai has formed a committee to ensure a seamless transition for all Sahara India Life’s policyholders. “This committee will be responsible for implementing Irdai's order within a specific timeframe. SBI Life has been instructed to take necessary measures to reach out to Sahara India Life policyholders, including establishing a dedicated cell to address their queries and publishing relevant details on its website,” said Irdai, adding that the insurance watchdog will be monitoring the situation closely.

But poorly designed workplaces can negatively impact the health of employees, especially those who are underrepresented--LGBTQAI+ communities, people with disabilities, and women. According to the report by Plum, a health insurance platform, acceptance for queer communities in the workplace is still in a nascent stage. People from the LGBTQAI+ communities are still witnessing discrimination including while renting houses, seeking jobs, getting insurance covers, opening bank accounts, etc. Nation Human Rights Commission's 2018 report highlighted that 96% of trans persons were denied jobs while 92% were denied participation in any economic activity. Additionally, policy terms such as HIV, Oral chemotherapy, mental health, maternity, and LGBTQAI coverage are not covered in the majority of the scenarios at workplaces. ""Diversity and inclusion are not about these (gender, sexuality, disabilities, etc) identities, it's a lot about who you are, where and how you can treat people and behave. What needs to happen is that you look at understanding who your workforce is and ask who is missing, not being seen, not being heard,"" Madhumita Venkataraman. Plum suggests companies craft health insurance policies that work for all kinds of employees and their dependents. According to Plum, for the LGBTQAI+ community, the policy should involve (gender reassignment, mental health, option for live-in partner coverage, and surrogacy)"" In India, gender reassignment surgeries cost anywhere between  ₹2 lakh to  ₹5 lakh for males and  ₹4 lakh to  ₹8 lakh for females. According to Plum, India's insurance penetration is just 4.2%, and pocket health expenses are 47% of the total health expenditure. "" Insurance coverage for elective surgeries is even more minuscule,"" the report said. ""A bad work culture impacts every employee and certain historically underrepresented groups suffer the most,"" Harish Iyer, Equal Right Activist. In the case of women staff, the representation is also abysmally low. According to Sebi's regulation, all listed companies need to have at least one woman as their board member. However, Excellent Enabler's survey of 100 listed Indian firms found that only 27% of firms have two or more independent women directors; 61% of companies have only one independent woman director while 12% have no woman director. Dr Saundarya Rajesh, Founder of Avtar Group said, "" Lack of diversity in leadership is one of the reasons behind women still being left behind. When leaders in an organisation are predominantly male, the inclusion of women can go ignored"". Plum's report suggested that companies must include terms like (egg freezing covers, IVF, maternity-related complications, and surrogacy) for women staff. Meesho offers 30 weeks of maternity leaves which can be extended by a few months, or up to a year. The startup also offers 30 days' leave for transitioning or gender reassignment surgery, covered under health insurance. The company's health insurance policy also includes terms like IVF and live-in partners. The company offers infertility coverage up to  ₹1 lakh. The policy comprises egg harvesting, freezing, and surrogacy with maternity benefits. WeWork also claims to have gender-neutral washrooms in the office.

Nearly 20 applications are awaiting approval with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), which has now set up a dedicated facilitation cell to support the registration application of companies and is providing on-tap no-objection certificates to fast-track approvals, an official familiar with the development said. About a dozen of these applicants may get a final nod to start insurance operations this year, the official said, requesting anonymity. In an emailed response, Irdai chairman Debasish Panda said that the business environment is favourable and conducive, and investors are attracted to the insurance sector, a sentiment underscored by the interest in new licences. “Few more applicants are in the pipeline at various stages of fulfilling the criteria for registration. These applicants are supported by dedicated facilitation cells of Irdai,” Panda said, without giving out the names of entities seeking insurance licences from the regulator. Earlier this year, the regulator approved the applications of two life insurance companies—Acko Life Insurance Ltd and Credit Access Life and Insurance Ltd— and a general insurer— Kshema General Insurance Ltd. For life insurance companies, these were the first approvals since 2011, while for general insurers, the last approval was in 2017. With the addition of new companies, there are now 25 life insurers and 34 general players operating in the country. “To attain the goal of ‘insurance for all’ by 2047, existing insurers need to scale up, new players must enter the sector, more distribution partners are required, more products are needed, and most importantly, usage of high-end technological solutions is a must,” the regulator said, highlighting the need to expand the insurance sector in the country by bringing in new players. “We need to tap the huge potential that exists in almost every line of business, be it life, health, personal accident, motor, property, etc. We also need to be prepared for new & emerging risks and innovative solutions required for the same,” Panda said. The Indian insurance market is the 10th largest globally, with the insurance industry registering a 13% growth during FY23. FDI in the insurance sector is about  ₹57,000 crore, with assets under management (AUM) growing by 11% in FY23 to reach  ₹60 trillion. As insurance penetration rises, the regulator expects the domestic insurance market to reach $200 billion by 2027. It has steadily increased from 2.7% in 2000 to 4.2% in 2020 and was 3.2% in 2021, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23 released in January. Rapid growth, coupled with its relatively low penetration, is attracting new investors. The post-pandemic period has accelerated market growth, with improved awareness about life and health insurance driving sales. The economic recovery and improved mobility have also boosted the demand for motor insurance. According to an Icra report, the general insurance industry’s GDPI (gross direct premium income) grew 17.2% from a year earlier in FY23 to  ₹2.4 trillion, buoyed by the resurgence of economic activities after the waning of covid-19 infections. A CareEdge report has also presented a positive picture of India’s life insurance market, with new business premiums or first-year premiums of companies growing by 17.9% in FY23 as against 12.9% growth in the previous year. The move towards lighter regulations, expedited processing and flexibility in raising capital has contributed to more companies vying to participate in the Indian insurance sector. Proposals to amend insurance laws to allow rationalized capital requirements, composite registration, one-time registration for intermediaries, value-added services by insurers, and the sale of other financial products, are currently under way to boost participation.

Further, ICRA projected that the insurance industry's gross direct premium would cross  ₹3 lakh crore mark by FY2025 as against  ₹2.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. According to the report, private insurers' combined ratio is likely to improve, and Return on Equity (RoE) is expected at 11.2-12.8% in FY2024 and 12.5-13.9% in FY2025. However, most of the PSU insurers are expected to witness a high combined ratio resulting in net losses, though it will be lower compared to the last few years, ICRA's report highlighted. It said that the capital requirement of three PSU general insurers (excluding New India) is estimated at a sizeable  ₹172-175 billion to meet a solvency of 1.50 times as of March 2024, assuming 100% forbearance from the regulator. Further, the report said that the health segment witnessed the sharpest growth, accounting for 48-50% of the incremental GDPI in FY2023. The auto segment also picked up pace after the Covid pandemic. The net claims ratio improved with the normalisation of health claims, partially offset by higher claims in the motor segment with increased vehicle movement, post-pandemic, ICRA said. However, the underwriting losses of public sector insurers increased because of wage revision and payment of associated arrears.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/insurance-premiums-to-turn-10-costlier-11683481899312.html,Insurance premiums to turn 10% costlier,3 min read.08 May 2023,"The insurance cost for Indian companies and motor vehicle owners is set to surge as global reinsurers, impacted by the war in Ukraine and other weather-related losses worldwide, have raised rates by 40-60%. The increase in reinsurance rates is expected to result in a minimum 10% rise in insurance premiums for properties, liabilities, marine, and motor covers in the coming months, top executives of Indian general insurers said. “The cost of reinsurance is expected to increase the property premiums by 8-10% across a few categories of risks. Similarly, we may witness an increase in motor and marine covers as well,” said Ritesh Kumar, managing director and chief executive of HDFC ERGO General Insurance Co. Ltd. India’s general insurance industry, comprising 24 companies and excluding standalone health and agriculture insurers, underwrote a gross premium of  ₹2.15 trillion during FY23, a 16% increase from the previous year. These insurers collectively hold 84% market share in the general insurance industry. Bhargav Dasgupta, managing director and CEO of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd, India’s largest private general insurer, said, “Extensive damages are happening, which in turn, increased the reinsurance costs for Indian insurers.” For India, reinsurance rates have risen roughly 40% and 60%, Dasgupta said. “Due to the exposure to catastrophe losses, (reinsurance) rates have gone up, which affects all lines of business—factories, properties, motor, everything it affects. The lines that got affected more are the commercial lines, for corporates,” Dasgupta said. HDFC Ergo’s Kumar stated that about 50% of the premiums for property and liability lines of business at the industry level are reinsured. Indian companies buy large insurance covers to mitigate the impact of unforeseen liabilities and catastrophic losses. They typically buy insurance cover to protect against fire, marine-related risks, engineering, and business interruptions. Motor insurance is, however, mandatory for all vehicle owners in India. Motor insurance alone contributed  ₹81,292 crore in premiums to the general insurance industry’s total business in FY2023. With the latest rise in reinsurance costs, the premium rates for buying insurance for vehicles such as passenger cars, bikes and commercial vehicles are likely to go up by 10-15% in the next few months, according to industry experts. At  ₹8,582 crore, ICICI Lombard’s motor business alone contributed around 40% of the company’s total premium in FY2023. The insurer’s total premium grew by 17% in FY23. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), during FY23, general insurers underwrote a total fire insurance premium of  ₹23,933 crore, marine insurance premium of  ₹5,058 crore, engineering insurance premium of  ₹4,281 crore, aviation insurance premium of  ₹889 crore and a liability insurance premium of  ₹4,863 crore. General insurers’ liability portfolio comprises insurance cover against workmen’s compensation, employers’ liability, public liability, product liability and other liability covers. HDFC Ergo’s Kumar said since central banks in Western countries have increased interest rates by 4.5-5% over the last 12 months, increasing the cost of capital for global reinsurers. Further, Kumar said the climate change uncertainty had gone up in recent years, leading to huge losses for the reinsurers.“Even though there has been a limited impact of catastrophes in India, the reinsurance cost for catastrophic covers has increased significantly during the year. In lieu of this, a significant impact is expected on the premiums for property and engineering risks, especially for flood cover,” Kumar said. He said that major reinsurers providing reinsurance capacities in India are based in Europe and the US. Globally, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Hannover Re, SCOR (France), Partner Re, Everest Re, Lloyd’s and Reinsurance Group of America are the top reinsurance firms. “A couple of events happened in the Ukraine war, which has increased the losses for the industry. The reinsurance rates have gone up also because of the climate change and the related losses that we are seeing,” said Dasgupta, whose company underwrote a total gross premium of  ₹21,025 crore for FY23, the highest among private players, commanding a market share of 8.2% in the general insurance industry.“The Western world, particularly, has had a series of catastrophe losses, and that has had a significant financial impact on the reinsurance market, according to ICICI Lombard’s Dasgupta. “At the same time, because of inflation, interest rates are going up, their (reinsurers’) investment book had had some hits. So the interest rates globally have gone up. Even this year for India also, for all of us in the market, reinsurance rates have gone up,” Dasgupta said.

Except for a blip in September 2022, the report by CareEdge said that the segment is on a roll reporting double-digit growth for the month of March 2023 continuing the FY23 trend. The industry reported a premium of  ₹24,271.4 crore for March 2023, an 11.5% growth y-o-y, the rating agency said in its report. General insurers’ March 2023 numbers were up by 9.7%, compared to an increase of 13.8% in March 2022, while for FY23, the growth which has been driven by the group health and motor segments, has been twice of what was witnessed last year, said the report. According to it, standalone private health insurers (SAHI) continued to move on their growth curve as March 2023 numbers touched  ₹3,428.4 crore up from  ₹2,829.9 crore in March 2022 and  ₹2,319.8 crore in February 2023. This monthly growth of 21.2% was higher than the 15.6% reported in March 2022 albeit the growth rate declined sequentially from 26.8% in February 2023. Meanwhile, the FY23 growth rate too was slower in the current year versus last year. The slowing was on account of the normalised growth in the government and retail health schemes in the current year, while last year, the same had posted significant growth, CareEdge said. Specialised insurers posted an increase of 16.2% in March 2023 compared to a drop of 18.3% in March 2022, meanwhile, FY23 numbers have remained subdued, growing at 5.3% vs. 14.7% in FY22. Observing the FY23 numbers, private players grew by 2.2 times their public counterparts given their strong market presence and relatively better solvency levels. The market share of private non-life insurance companies has witnessed a sustained increase to 62% in FY23 from 59% in FY22 and 57% in FY21. For the month of March 2023, the trend continued with private companies reporting higher growth of 14.8% while public sector non-life insurance companies posted a growth of 5.8%, said the report. CareEdge estimates that the Indian non-life insurance market would grow by approximately 13-15% over the medium term. The health insurance segment is on track to breach the  ₹1 lakh crore mark, while motor insurance premiums will cross  ₹85,000 crore in FY24 given the fact that they have already crossed  ₹90,000 crore and  ₹80,000 crore mark respectively during the last year, the ratings agency said. The growth would be driven by the popularity of health insurance products/schemes, growing demand for motor insurance (Third party & Owner damage) products, expected rise in per capita / disposable income levels, a greater volume of transactions under segments such as fire, marine, export credit, customised products, especially in motor and health insurance and gradual introduction of new products. According to the rating agency, insurance companies will aim to improve their profitability by stabilising the loss ratios that were affected by the pandemic. They plan to control management expenses in compliance with regulations, and strengthen their distribution networks by adding more partners and using digital and online channels. The agency also anticipates continued growth in investment yields due to rising interest rates and the availability of growth capital, which will help support the companies' growth in the future. The companies are anticipated to make significant investments in digital enablement across all distribution channels, including expanding their online/digital channels to simplify the insurance purchase process. They will also boost their underwriting capacities with automated/AI-based underwriting while keeping a focus on cost improvement to maintain margins. Although the outlook is expected to remain stable in the medium term, the agency warns that intensified competition, an uncertain geopolitical environment, and high inflation could negatively impact economic growth and, subsequently, the non-life insurance sector., the agency said.

In terms of the sheer volume, no other company matches the insurance giant. In terms of premiums collected, it continues to hold a market share of 62.58 per cent as on March 2023. According to the Life Insurance Council data, private insurers have also collected a considerable amount of premium in March due to last-minute customer rush to benefit ahead of the April 1 withdrawal of tax exemptions for non-linked policies. LIC's premium growth for fiscal 2023 is the second highest among its listed peers, with HDFC Life leading with 18.83 per cent, SBI Life at 16.22 per cent and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company at 12.55 per cent. In FY23 while the insurance giants' individual single premium grew 3.30 per cent and individual non-single premium grew 10 per cent, its group single premium grew 21.76 per cent to  ₹1,67,235 crore from  ₹1,37,350.36 crore. For March 2023, LIC's premium for the individual category exceeds  ₹10,000 crore, the highest amongst all life insurance companies, followed by HDFC Life, SBI Life and Tata AIA Life gathering  ₹2,989.17 crore,  ₹2,318.77 crore and  ₹1,884.41 crore, respectively. In the individual non-single premium segment, it grew 10.49 per cent from  ₹5,501.12 crore in March 2022 to  ₹6,077.97 crore in March 2023. According to a report published in January by Kotak Institutional Equities, listed insurers are expected to deliver a 15-60 per cent growth in their value of the new business for fourth quarter (Q4 FY23) due to improvement in term business, nonpar business, and better operating leverage. Broking firm Motilal Oswal in its February 2023 report initiated a ""buy"" call on the LIC's share with a target price of  ₹830 per share post their Q3 FY23 results update and on basis of September FY24E (Estimates) of 0.8 times Enterprise Value.

https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/irdais-new-rules-on-commission-payments-give-insurers-more-flexibility-to-manage-their-expenses-11680011847465.html,IRDAI’s new rules on commission payments give insurers more flexibility to manage their expenses,3 min read.28 Mar 2023,"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has approved new rules on the payment of commissions to insurance agents or insurance intermediaries by insurers. Under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, 2023, notified on 26 March 2023, the insurance regulator has replaced the earlier individual cap on commission payments on insurance products with an overall cap on expenses of management of insurers. The rule is applicable for life and non-life insurers (general and standalone health insurers). Hence, the move can provide more flexibility to insurers in managing their expenses. These regulations will come into force from 1 April 2023 and will be reviewed once every three years. The move will benefit policyholders: The IRDAI announced some important regulatory changes, which is good for policy buyers and the insurance industry, i.e., the revised Expenses of Management (EOM) and commission limits for the industry. Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, “We firmly believe that the shift from product level commissions to a company-wide limit of expenses, as proposed through the proposed regulations, will ensure parity across varying business models while rendering greater flexibility in managing expenses for insurers. Moreover, with the majority of the insurers above the prescribed norms of expenses and with the industry reeling with a combined ratio of more than 118%, these EOM limits will help in bringing cost discipline and take the industry in the right direction of prudency and profitability. This should hence translate into better pricing and products for customers in the medium to long term.” Anil Kumar Aggarwal, MD and CEO at Shriram General Insurance, echoed the industry’s sentiments, “The removal of the cap on commission payments will positively impact the insurance sector. It will facilitate greater product innovation, development of new product distribution models and lead to more customer-centric operations. It will also increase insurance penetration and provide flexibility to insurers in managing their expenses. Overall, it will smoothen adherence to compliance norms.” The move will benefit the Distribution-led business model: The revised regulations will provide an extra expense allowance for Insurtech expenses, spending on insurance awareness, and rural and social schemes of the government, etc. Abhishek Bondia, principal officer and managing director of SecureNow.in, said, “This is a positive move for the industry and boosts insurance penetration. Distribution-led business models would likely attract more investments. Insurers would be more able to incentivise reach for priority segments such as individual protection plans, commercial insurance for small businesses, and tier-2 cities. According to the IRDAI notification, these regulations‘ objectives are to enhance the regulation’s responsiveness to market innovation. To facilitate the insurers in developing new business models, products, strategies, internal processes and enable easy compliance with the Regulations while fulfilling the regulatory objectives. And to provide the insurers with the flexibility to manage their expenses based on their growth aspirations and the ever-changing insurance needs with an objective to improve insurance penetration. However, clarity around the total allowable expenses of management, including commission and operating costs for the insurer, is still awaited. Mayank Gupta - Co-Founder and COO of Zopper, said, “The authorities are clearly moving the system towards a more transparent environment and encouraging flexibility. With only top limits being defined, the market will move towards more vigorous negotiations and encourage the best deals to surface. The customers will surely have more robust, well-designed, cost-effective product offerings by stable organisations they can trust in the long run.” N. S. Kannan, managing director & CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said, ""The increased flexibility in commission limits will allow insurers to react to market forces in a quicker manner, thereby supporting the IRDAI’s vision of improving penetration of insurance in the country. The expenses of management have increased allowability in the later years of the policy while limiting expenses in the initial year. This will persuade insurers to work on improving long-term persistency, which in turn will improve the customer proposition as well as the Company’s profitability.""

Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative effects on the global and national economies and health systems, its single but most powerful positive effect was to raise awareness of the value of insurance. According to the survey, while the health and life insurance categories have seen significant growth in the personal insurance segment, the pandemic has also increased awareness and acceptance of Health and Term Life insurance in the corporate insurance segment. Likewise, motor insurance has witnessed high demand from corporate employees as well. Also, there is a rising need to understand individual corporate insurance among businesses, employees, and other stakeholders. The benefits offered by companies are fixed in the standard group insurance model, there is little room for personalisation, and the programme expires once the employee leaves the company. Businesses are shifting to offering employees personalised employee insurance solutions where they can take advantage of exclusive benefits, prices and features that are available only to them. At the same time, the global recession has made corporate employees rethink about the benefits they receive from their organisations. In a situation like this, the response towards individual employee insurance, where the benefits are linked to the corporate, but stay the same way, even if the employee is no longer associated with the organization has been in huge demand. In the last year, 250+ companies with close to 500,000 employees opted for personalised employee insurance policies through Elephant.in. The demand for this kind of insurance is growing fast, not only in the metro cities but also in Tier 2/3 cities. People within the age group of 31 - 40 years have been the largest users of individual employee insurance. One interesting part of the survey outcome has been the high usage of individual employee insurance among women. While men still continue to hold the larger share of employee insurance buyers, there has been a consistent growth trajectory amongst women in this category. Working women consist of around 33% of the women’s population and 23% of traffic at Elephant.in have been female in the last year. Women hold a significant population, and many of them are moving towards decision-making. Thus, this is a very heartening ratio, as it projects growing awareness and the buying decision amongst women for insurance. There is also some movement in the start-up ecosystem towards individual employee insurance. However, more and more start-ups need to join the individual employee insurance bandwagon. Start-ups today value the contribution of their employees and go to the extreme extent of retaining their star performers. Individual employee insurance is a significant tool for hiring and retaining employees for the longer term. The survey reveals that, although individual employee insurance is growing in the country, more and more organisations, as well as employees, need to know about the benefits of this unique proposition. In traditional group insurance, the benefits are fixed, there is minimal customisation, and the insurance ends once the employee ends their tenure with the organisation. In individual employee insurance products, the insurance options, as well as benefits, are equivalent to individual insurance policies. Added to this, employees can avail of insurance policies at the best prices, compared to the premiums available in the open market.

Customers who purchase the ""Immediate Income with Booster"" variant receive additional guaranteed income every fifth policy year in addition to the lifelong income, which begins after 30 days from the policy issuance date. In the ‘Deferred Income’ variant, customers have the flexibility to choose when they want the income to start, as per their financial goals. Customers can start receiving income as early as the second policy year or as late as the 13th policy year. This gives customers the flexibility to receive income as per their requirements. Over and above these benefits, ICICI Pru Gold offers customers the option to accumulate their income in a Savings Wallet instead of receiving it as regular payments. Customers can withdraw the amount accumulated in their Savings Wallet, either partially or in full, depending on their financial needs. The Premium Offset option enables customers to pay their future premiums from the accumulated corpus. Amit Palta, Chief Distribution Officer, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said, “Rising inflation is nudging many consumers to build an additional source of guaranteed income apart from the income they receive from their profession. This was the genesis of designing ICICI Pru Gold. This innovative long-term savings product provides customers with a guaranteed source of income cushioned from market fluctuations. ICICI Pru Gold is specifically designed to provide customers with flexibility in terms of liquidity and can be customised to meet their income needs. All three variants of this product, i.e. Immediate Income, Immediate Income with Booster and Deferred Income, provide customers with a combination of guaranteed and bonus-oriented regular income, besides life cover. We have also introduced ‘Premium Offset’, a novel feature that provides customers the option to offset future premiums against the corpus accumulated in the Savings Wallet. With this long-term savings product, we aim to enable our customers to meet their diverse income needs without having to worry about the uncertainties impacting their finances.”  Catch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
