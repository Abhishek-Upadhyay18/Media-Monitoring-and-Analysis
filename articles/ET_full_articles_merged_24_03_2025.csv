Here are the challenges it could face,"06 Mar, 2025, 09:27 PM IST","Reuters Top travel executives are expressing concerns that the United States may face difficulties in organising and hosting the 2026 World Cup unless significant improvements or adjustments are made quickly. World Cup 2026 is set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico City's famous Estadio Azteca will host the opening fixture. The United States' first match scheduled for the following day in Southern California. The tournament, which will see 48 teams participating, will conclude with the final on July 19, 2026 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Top travel executives' insights into World Cup 2026 US Travel Association president and CEO Geoff Freeman and MGM Resorts International president and CEO William Hornbuckle expressed their worries about whether the US travel system will be ready to manage the large number of foreign travellers expected to visit for the soccer event happening next summer, according to a CNN Sports report. Also Read : Bitcoin’s price soars again; experts suggest it could reach $1 million by year end Live Events World Cup 2026: What problems will the visitors face? The concerns cover a wide range of issues. Long wait times for fan visa approvals could discourage many people from trying to travel to the US for the tournament. Outdated technology and staff shortages might cause significant delays for visitors going through customs upon arrival. There are also concerns that security lines could become so long that they stretch outside airports. Furthermore, the absence of a dedicated interagency task force during the Donald Trump administration means that there has not been a well-coordinated federal response to address these various challenges. The report also cited Freeman stating that although the tournament is still over 15 months away, time is running out to address the list of concerns. Despite this, Geoff Freeman emphasised that he remains hopeful the administration can still take action and correct course to ensure the issues are resolved before the event. He also pointed out that more focus is needed on what it takes to make the event a success. If things continue at the current pace, there will be difficulties, but he believes it’s not too late to invest the necessary resources to tackle these challenges and ensure the tournament is the best World Cup ever. FIFA's plan on making World Cup 2026 a success A FIFA spokesperson told CNN that the organisation is working closely with the US government to ensure the tournament's success. They are confident that the Trump administration will take the necessary steps to make the event run smoothly for fans worldwide. The spokesperson also highlighted that the current administration was in office when the 2026 bid process was successfully completed and had signed the government guarantees involved.

If the application is approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ), M Pallonji Group will hold a majority stake of 51%, with additional investments from Federal Bank and several family offices. The group's promoters, Mehli Mistry and Pheroze Mistry, are cousins of the Shapoorji Mistry family. Mehli Mistry also serves as a trustee on Tata Trusts. The group has appointed Aditya Sharma, chief distribution officer at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, as CEO of its proposed general insurance venture. The group did not respond to ET's request for comment, while Sehgal declined to comment. Sehgal is investing in his personal capacity, besides drawing firm commitments from a couple of other family offices. Live Events The venture, currently in the initial regulatory stages, will undergo IRDAI's R1, R2, and R3 approval process. The R1 stage evaluates business projections, board approvals, and financial commitments, while R2 defines share capital requirements. R3 is the final approval. The company is expected to launch with an initial investment of ₹200 crore, backed by six investors, according to one of the sources. M Pallonji Group has prior experience in the insurance sector as a long-term investor in PNB MetLife, where it holds nearly a 20% stake. The group intends to exit this investment only during an IPO. As of September 30, 2024, MetLife increased its stake in PNB MetLife to 48.91%, while PNB holds 30%. The remaining shares are divided among other investors, including M Pallonji Group. This marks a rare instance of an Indian conglomerate taking a majority stake in a general insurance venture, in contrast to recent entrants that have primarily been foreign investors or private equity firms. M Pallonji Group's businesses span various sectors, including painting, dredging, stevedoring, logistics, shipping, finance, investments, life insurance, automobile dealerships, and the manufacturing of speciality coatings. The general insurance industry has been growing in double digits over the past several years. In FY24, it expanded by 15.5% year-on-year, with the gross direct premium income (GDPI) reaching ₹2.79 lakh crore. ICRA projects the sector to grow by 32% to ₹3.7 lakh crore by FY26. Over the last decade, corporate-backed entrants in the insurance sector have been limited, with most recent approvals granted to private equity-led ventures such as GoDigit (backed by Fairfax) and Acko General Insurance. Kshema General Insurance, launched in recent years, focuses on crop insurance. IRDAI chairman Debasish Panda has emphasised the need for greater corporate participation to improve insurance penetration, which currently stands at just 1% of GDP. In the February budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the foreign direct investment cap in the insurance sector from 74% to 100% to support long-term capital inflows. The industry currently comprises 26 life insurers, 27 general insurers, seven standalone health insurers, one domestic reinsurer and 13 foreign reinsurers. It has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. In FY24, total premiums reached ₹11.23 lakh crore, with assets under management at ₹67.57 lakh crore. Insurance penetration was at 3.7%, and density at $95 - both significantly below the global averages of 7% and $889, respectively. (",article tag

By asking “Aapka aage ka plan kya hai?” , the campaign encourages people to reflect on their aspirations and take proactive steps to secure their golden years.

We understand our customers’ aspirations, and ‘‘Aapka aage ka kya plan hai?” is their call to action. We’re here to help them plan for what’s next, from travel and new experiences to a financially secure retirement.” The campaign’s digital film brings this message to life through a conversation between two friends who, after a jog, sit on a park bench reflecting on life after retirement. One friend asks, “Tunay socha kabhi …ek din hum bhi retire ho jaayenge?” The other paints a vivid picture of his retirement dream - owning an apple orchard in Himachal’s Thanedar, employing locals, and starting a homemade jam business with global exports.

Live Events Chugh also made a case for the introduction of a separate tax deduction for term insurance and extending the tax deduction on life insurance premiums under the new tax regime. According to the Annual Report of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), the country's insurance penetration in 2023-24 was 3.7 per cent compared to 4 per cent in 2022-23. The penetration for life insurance industry marginally declined from 3 per cent in 2022-23 to 2.8 per cent during 2023-24. The penetration with respect to the non-life insurance industry remained the same at 1 per cent during 2023-24. Subrata Mondal, MD and CEO of IFFCO Tokio General Insurance said the Union Budget provides an essential opportunity for the government to implement reforms that can address industry challenges and encourage the broader adoption of insurance products. One key expectation is the enhancement of tax incentives for policyholders to promote wider uptake of insurance, he added. Another priority is increasing budgetary support for government-backed insurance schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Ayushman Bharat, he added. ""They would significantly improve access to insurance for underserved populations, particularly in rural and economically weaker regions,"" Mondal said. Sameer Bansal, MD & CEO, PNB MetLife, said that while India is a fast-growing economy fuelled by its rising middle-class population of 25-45-year-olds, the proportion of people above the age of 60 is equally increasing at a rapid pace. Financial stability is a cornerstone of a secure future. One of our hopes for the upcoming budget is to see support for pension and annuity plans, which are key financial instruments for the retirement planning needed to create that stability, he added. ""Tax support for pension plans offered by life insurers on par with the National Pension Scheme will provide both greater choice and allow diversification of assets into multiple pension plans,"" he said. Bansal also urged the government to consider removing GST on premiums for annuity plans to support pensioners and make annuities more affordable and accessible. Universal Sompo General Insurance Managing Director and CEO Sharad Mathur opined that strengthening the insurance sector is essential for driving financial resilience, economic stability, and inclusive growth. With targeted reforms and incentives like the reduction of GST on Health insurance, we can unlock the true potential of insurance, ensuring wider coverage, encouraging innovation, and building a secure future for every individual and business, Mathur said. Srikanth Kandikonda, Chief Financial Officer, ManipalCigna Health Insurance, said that given the rising healthcare costs and the need for higher sum insured cover, the government should reduce the tax burden by increasing the limits under Section 80D of income tax for premiums paid for health insurance to Rs 50,000 for all and Rs 1 lakh for senior citizens. ""This is crucial for achieving the government's vision 'Insurance for all by 2047' and would substantially reduce the financial burden on families investing in their health and financial wellbeing,"" Kandikonda added. During 2023-24, the non-life insurance industry underwrote a total direct premium of Rs 2.90 lakh crore in India, registering a growth of 12.76 per cent from the previous year. There were 26 life insurers, 25 general insurers, eight standalone health insurers, 12 reinsurers and foreign reinsurance branches, and two specialised insurers, registered as of March 31, 2024.

Most of us buy a life insurance plan to financially safeguard our loved ones, in case of any unfortunate or unforeseen life events. A policyholder pays premiums regularly over a set time period, so that in case a family's main breadwinner passes away unexpectedly, the surviving dependents receive monetary assistance or payout from the insurer. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 However, buying a life insurance plan could all be in vain, if you your insurer does not honor the claims made by policyholders. How can you figure out if your life insurance company makes timely payouts on claims made by its policyholders? What percentage of the total claims received by the insurer during the year does it pay and how much is delayed? To understand how effective your life insurer is in claim settlement, you can take help of the claim settlement ratio . Insurance watchdog IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) annually releases a handbook of Indian Insurance Statistics detailing the claim settlement ratios of all life insurers in the country. What is a claim settlement ratio? Claim settlement ratio refers to the percentage of claims that an insurance company honors, or pays, out of the total claims that it receives during a particular period. For instance, if an insurer has a claim settlement ratio of 95% for a 30 days settlement, it means that the company likely honours 95 claims out of every 100 claims it receives from policyholders within 30 days of receiving the claim. Claim settlement ratio can help you gauge how likely it is that an insurer will honour, or pay you, if you make a claim. As a rule of thumb, a higher claim settlement ratio, i.e. closer to 100%, is positive, since it indicates that the insurer is trustworthy, and honours almost all claims made by policyholders in the shortest possible window of 30 days. Live Events In case an insurance company has a low claim settlement ratio, it reflects that the company potentially has a track record of either delaying the claim or at worst denying claims. Note that while claim settlement ratio is an important metric, it should not be the sole factor on which you decide your life insurer. You should also consider other factors like coverage offered and premium payable before taking a final call. Latest claim settlement ratio of life insurers in 2025, per IRDAI IRDAI recently released a list of the claim settlement ratios of all life insurers in the country, as of 2023-2024. During this period, the claim settlement ratio of the entire life insurance industry, which includes private players and LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) stood at 96.82% for claims settled within a 30-day period. This implies that India’s life insurers honoured 96.82% of the total individual death claim requests received by them in FY2023-24 within 30 days of receiving the claim. On the other hand, India’s private life insurers were able to honour around 99% of all the individual death claim requests within 30 days of claims that were presented to them in FY 2023-24. Claims that have been honored and settled within 30 days from intimation are considered most effective. What is claim settlement ratio by number? Number here refers to the number of life insurance policies sold by each life insurer during the year. According to data, certain life insurers such as Kotak Mahindra, Ageas Federal, Future Generali and Aviva emerged with 100% claim settlement ratios, which means that they were able to honour individual death claims on all their policies within 30 days of receiving the claim. Amongst bigger insurers, Axis Max Life Insurance emerged with a 99.79% claim settlement ratio. HDFC had a claim settlement ratio of 99.97%, settling about 19333 policies within a span of 30 days. In terms of most number of policies settled within 30 days, LIC took lead with 7,99,612 policies settled in less than 30 days.

What is claim settlement ratio by benefit amount? Honoring a claim is not the only parameter prospective policyholders should look for in a life insurer. You should also check how much percentage of the total amount collected by the company is ultimately paid out in claim settlement. A higher claim settlement ratio (by benefit amount) means that the company is paying out a higher proportion of the total claims it has collected during the year. This is a positive sign, since it reflects the company’s will to offer fair settlement. If a company has a low claim settlement ratio, it simply implies that it is delaying making payouts, or completely denying claims presented to it. Again, benefit amount paid within 30 days of claim intimation is considered most timely and effective. Both these claim settlement ratios must be looked at in conjunction so that policyholders get a sense of how financially strong their life insurer is.

Which cities are emerging? Naukri shares that emerging cities like Indore, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar, and Jaipur are witnessing impressive growth. Udaipur saw a 17% growth overall in 2024, while Indore was up by 14%. In 2024, Odisha experienced a 22% growth, and both Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan saw an 18% growth each. These cities are emerging as key growth hubs in India. Sarbojit Mallick, co-founder, Instahyre shares during and post pandemic there was a reverse migration of talent to their hometowns. As time has passed, a significant percentage of this talent chose to stay instead of returning to established (but costly) tech hubs like Bengaluru or NCR. This has resulted in smaller cities emerging as tech hubs with great potential to accelerate India's growth as a tech-forward nation. For example, cities like Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, Pune [already a major tech hub], and Mangalore and Coimbatore down south are well-established due to major IT firms taking first steps in sourcing talent from them, like Infosys [Mysuru], Wipro [Coimbatore], MetLife [Jaipur]. Live Events How is job recruitment evolving in these cities? Naukri shares that overall, there is an increasing demand for roles in digital marketing, marketing, and design. The Sales & Marketing department saw a 7% growth in December 2024, with significant increases in positions such as Campaign Manager (20% increase), Direct Marketing (8% increase), and Marketing Leadership (6% increase), reflecting the strengthening of marketing functions. Non-metro cities like Jaipur (2902 job postings), Kochi (2150 postings), Coimbatore (1917 postings) are seeing a surge in job postings, indicating a rise in recruitment activities even outside of metro areas. Mallick adds that availability of jobs within their hometowns has reduced talent attrition - a major pain point for recruiters in the tech domain. Some more emerging hubs are Bhopal, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Guwahati, Vizag, Ranchi, Hubbali, Tiruchirapalli, Lucknow, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Madurai, and Vellore. Aiding in GCC growth: Nitin Barekere, VP - HR, Omega Healthcare agrees, sharing that while Bangalore and Hyderabad have become destinations for many of the Fortune 500 Companies in setting-up their GCC and Developmental centres, other cities like Pune, Coimbatore, Indore, Bhubaneswar, and Chandigarh are emerging as notable tech hubs in India. He adds that these cities combine a strong educational ecosystem, a growing pool of skilled talent, and supportive government policies aimed at promoting technology-driven growth. Pune & Coimbatore are gaining prominence due to their thriving startup culture, excellent engineering colleges, and growing IT infrastructure. Indore has positioned itself as a tech hub with its cost-effective real estate and a workforce that is increasingly skilled in digital technologies. Bhubaneswar, recognized as a ""Smart City,"" is leveraging government initiatives and a focus on IT parks to attract major companies. Similarly, Chandigarh benefits from its proximity to educational institutions and an improving tech ecosystem. Factors such as access to talent pool, lower operational costs, better work-life balance, regional & global connectivity, and growing infrastructure make these cities attractive for companies and employees alike. Moreover, the rise of hybrid work models allows organizations to tap into regional talent pools, further driving the development of these aspirational tech hubs. Mallick agrees, quotes a report by Deloitte-Nasscom that projects the GCC market to reach $100 billion by 2030, employing over 2.5 million Indians. Bengaluru, NCR, Mumbai and Hyderabad are grappling with strained infrastructure and spiraling costs. In this scenario, the rise of the smaller city is a practical outcome which will stand India in good stead to compete on a global level. The support given to today's entrepreneurs might give birth to home-grown tech giants beyond ITES. ( Originally published on Jan 23, 2025 )",article tag

IGE holds a 20.3% stake in the life insurance company while Jammu & Kashmir Bank holds 11.26%. The fresh issue of shares is part of a process to induct the state-owned Punjab National Bank into the life insurer. The regulator has cleared the proposal, but with riders. Irda, after a detailed examination, found that certain regulatory issues do not allow some of the existing shareholders to subscribe to the fresh issue and asked them not to subscribe to it. ""This constraint (of some existing shareholders to subscribe to new shares) was impacting the solvency position of the insurer and limiting its ability to grow,"" the regulator said in a circular. MetLife is a joint venture between Jammu & Kashmir Bank, the US-based MetLife International (26%) and private investors, including Elpro International (13%) and M Pallonji Group (26.1%). The deal will be cleared after some of the existing shareholders reduce their stake. Insurance companies are mandated to maintain a 1.5% solvency margin.

The insurer is understood to have paid an upfront commission of over 500 crore to the bank as well. Irda's report on bancassurance says that companies amortise upfront commission in three years.
