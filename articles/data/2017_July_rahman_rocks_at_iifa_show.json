    "content": "The 18th IIFA Rocks was a celebration of A.R. Rahman's journey in cinema. And nothing could dampen the spirit tonight. Not even the incessant rains that conspired since morning. Though they were intermittent rains, they too gave themselves a breather post 10 p.m. just to allow the maestro enthrall the audience.\nThe host for the night Manish Paul and Riteish Deshmukh had the audience in splits with their one liners. The show started with Kamal Khan singing all the Chartbusters and also had the audience grooving to many of the Salman Khan numbers.\nJonita Gandhi, left, A. R.

Rahman's show started with the popular track from                         Dil Se        . Joining him on stage were the very talented Jonita Gandhi, Neeti Mohan, Javed Ali, Benny Dayal and Haricharan. Other numbers included ‘Dil Hai Chota Sa’ (                        Roja        ), ‘Agar Tum saath Ho’ (                        Tamasha        ), ‘Naadan Parindey’ (                        Rockstar        ) ‘Humma Humma’ (                        Bombay        ) and ‘Enna Sonna’ (                        Ok Jaanu        ).
