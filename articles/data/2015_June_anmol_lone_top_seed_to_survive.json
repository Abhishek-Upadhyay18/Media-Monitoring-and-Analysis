The main draw featuring 64 players in the u-13 boys section, and 32 players in the other three singles events, will be played from Thursday to Saturday. The tournament, offering a total scholarship fund of Rs. 300,000, has already proved to be a “'round the clock” badminton festival for the players and their parents. — Special Correspondent\nPublished - June 25, 2015 02:33 am IST\nbadminton",
