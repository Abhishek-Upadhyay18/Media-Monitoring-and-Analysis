The app is designed to be a one-stop shop providing insurance-related information, anytime, anywhere, such as policy features, premium due details besides providing fund value and portfolio details. It has the ability to understand customer intent and provide tailored responses, the company said.\nKhushi can interact with customers via text as well as speech. When requested, the app can also locate the nearest PNB MetLife branch, arrange a call back from call centre representatives, fix an appointment with an advisor and much more, according to the company.\nThe app, which is available for android phones, has been built by MetLife’s innovation center - Lumen Lab — in Singapore with PNB MetLife in India.\nUnveiling the app, managing director and CEO of PNB MetLife Ashish Srivastava said the AI-powered app would deliver enhanced customer experience. “We will continue our digitisation efforts and explore innovative platforms as traditional ways of selling insurance and servicing customers evolve,” he said in a release.\nIn 2016, the company had launched ‘conVRse’, virtual reality (VR) service platform as well as ‘eBranch’, a paperless digital platform enabling real time transfer of information. Going forward, PNB MetLife would upgrade Khushi to include other languages and IOS devices, the release said.\nChief information officer Samrat Das said the app would play a role of an assistant to the users and designed in such a way that it required minimum bandwidth.\nPublished - October 22, 2018 10:56 pm IST",
