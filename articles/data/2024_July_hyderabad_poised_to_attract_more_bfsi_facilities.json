The developments reflect the growing confidence in the city’s robust infrastructure, skilled workforce, overall business environment and a stable political environment.\nThe office leasing activity is an indicator of growing engagement of BFSI in Hyderabad with the sector H1-2024 accounting for as much one third of office space offtake. It also highlights the supportive, robust ecosystem Hyderabad fosters and benefits not just large corporations but also for startups within the BFSI sector.\nPublished - July 09, 2024 08:26 pm IST",
