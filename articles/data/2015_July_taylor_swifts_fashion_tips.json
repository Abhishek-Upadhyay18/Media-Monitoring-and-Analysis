    "content": "Singer Taylor Swift surprised a male fan on blogging website Tumblr by giving him style tips for his prom.\nThe fan posted a photograph of himself posing in two different looks and captioned the image saying: “So prom is on Thursday and I need to know, tie or bow tie?”\nThe                         Shake It Off         hit-maker then surprised the boy with her response and suggested that he wear the tie to look like a “modern movie star”.\n“I like the tie, but honestly, both are great. I just feel like you look like a 50s movie star in the bow tie, but more like a modern movie star in the tie. Depends on what vibe you’re wanting to convey, but I’d say the tie. Great suit btw! (sic),” Swift replied.\nAnd while Swift is happy to dish out style advice, she previously revealed she turns to friends Lena Dunham and Zooey Deschanel for inspiration when it comes to her own outfits.\n“For fashion inspiration... Lena Dunham always has great websites and shops at great stores. She always tells me her newest obsession, whether it is a new website, a blog or a store; she’s really good with that stuff. And Zooey Deschanel is one of the most fashionable people I know,” she said.\nPublished - July 12, 2015 05:21 pm IST\nfashion\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        The Hindu MetroPlus",
