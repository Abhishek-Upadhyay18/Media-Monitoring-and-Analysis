Ltd. has tied-up with Religare Health Insurance to offer a product that would cover health, death and illness, said a top official.\n“We have tied up with Religare Health Insurance, wherein we will bundle and sell their health insurance policy with our life insurance policy,” said Sameer Bansal, chief distribution officer, PNB MetLife India Insurance Co. Ltd.\n“The product will be offered during mid-December. It will be a seamless integration [exercise] to ensure that it comes as a single policy to a customer,” Mr. Bansal said.The tie-up will offer additional earning opportunity for the life insurer’s distribution channel partners,” he said.\nAsked about the growth plans, he said for FY20 the life insurer had set target of 18-20% growth in top-line, increasing the number of branches from 107 to 200 in two years and policy renewal ratio from 78% to 81%.\nTalking about the Tamil Nadu business, he said it was the fourth largest life insurance market for the firm after Maharashtra, New Delhi and Karnataka. The life insurer secured about 3% of its premium from Tamil Nadu, which was low and plans were on to raise it further.\n“Since the base in Tamil Nadu is small, we are posting good growth. We have aggressive plans for Tamil Nadu to expand base and to appoint more agents,” he said.\nPNB MetLife ended FY19 with a total premium (including renewal premium) of about ₹4,000 crore and in the first five months of the current year it has done ₹1,200 crore, registering 18%-20% growth. “Despite slowdown, we are on track,” he added.\nPublished - September 26, 2019 10:39 pm IST\ninsurance",
